            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>So great alſo was the care of our Anceſtors, not onely to obſerve, but to increaſe Religion, that by decree of Senate, ten of the Sons of the chief men were ſent out of their moſt flouriſhing and opulent City to the ſeveral people of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> to learn the Order and Diſcipline of Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And when they had reſolved to worſhip <hi>Ceres</hi> after the Greek manner, they ſent for <hi>Calcitana,</hi> or, as others ſay, <hi>Calliphimia,</hi> from <hi>Vilia,</hi> which had not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the name of a City, to be their Prieſteſs, that they might not want a skilful Governeſs of the antient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Goddeſs: To whom having in the City a moſt ſtately Temple dedicated, and being warn'd in the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Books to appeaſe the ancient Goddeſs <hi>Ceres</hi> in the time of <hi>Gracchus</hi> Tumult, they ſent ten perſons to <hi>Enna,</hi> where they believed her Sacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were firſt inſtituted, to make an Atonement for themſelves.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Metellus</hi> High-Prieſt, when <hi>Poſthumius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and alſo a Flamin of <hi>Mars,</hi> deſired <hi>Africa</hi> for his Province to make War in, commanded him under a penalty not to depart the City, thereby to deſert his Functions; believing that <hi>Poſthumius</hi> could not ſafely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture himſelf in Martial Combats, when the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Mars</hi> were neglected.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Praiſeworthy was the Reverence of the Twelve, but more to be extoll'd, the obedience of the Twenty four Faſces: for <hi>Titus Gracchus</hi> ſent Letters to the Colledge of <hi>Augurs</hi> out of his Province, by which he gave them to underſtand, that having perus'd certain Books belonging to the Sacred Myſteries of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he found that the Tabernacle was erroneouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the grand Conſular Aſſemblies for Election, which he had caus'd to be made; which thing being reported to the Senate, by command thereof <hi>C. Figulus</hi> returning out of <hi>Gallia, Scipio Naſiea</hi> from <hi>Corſica,</hi> both laid down their Conſulſhips.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the ſame reaſon, <hi>P. Cloelius</hi> of <hi>Sicilie, M. Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Cethegus,</hi> in <hi>C. Claudius,</hi> for that the Entrails were leſs reverently brought to the Altars of the Gods than they ought to have been, at ſeveral times, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wars, were commanded and compelled to leave the Flaminſhip. And becauſe a Bee fell upon the head of <hi>Sulpicius</hi> while he was ſacrificing, he loſt the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The peeping of a Mouſe being overheard, was the reaſon that <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> quitted the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, and <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> ceaſed to be Maſter of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To this we may add, that <hi>P. Licinius</hi> High-Prieſt thought fit to give the laſh to a Veſtal-Virgin, for that one night ſhe had been negligent of the Holy fire.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But <hi>Veſta</hi> her ſelf ſav'd the Hand-maid of <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> the Veſtal, who had let the fire out; for while ſhe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41263:10"/>was worſhiping, and had laid her Vail which was very rich upon the Hearth, preſently the fire caught hold thereof.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. No wonder then that the indulgence of the Gods was ſo great in preſerving and increaſing their Empire: for ſuch a ſcrupulous care ſeemed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſmalleſt concernments of Religion, ſo that our City is to be thought never to have had her eyes off from the moſt exact worſhip of the Gods. And therefore when <hi>Marcellus,</hi> five times Conſul, having taken <hi>Claſtidium,</hi> and after that <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> would have in performance of his Vows, erected a Temple to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Vertue: He was oppoſed by the Colledge of Prieſts, who deni'd that one Domicil could be rightly dedicated to two Gods. For if any Prodigy ſhould happen, it would remain doubtful to which Deity ſhould be made Addreſs: nor was it the cuſtome to ſacrifice at once to two Deities, unleſs to ſome in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Upon which Admonition of the Prieſts, <hi>Marcellus</hi> in two ſeveral Temples ſet up the Images of Honour and Vertue; whereby it came to paſs, that neither the authority of ſo great a man was any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Colledge, nor the addition of expence any impediment to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> but that all Juſtice and Obſervation was given to Religion.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41263:10"/>things; believing they ſhould the more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſole command of humane things, if they were conſtantly and truly obedient to the Divine power.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Which reſolution hath been alſo bred up in the breaſts of private perſons. For when the City was taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and that the Quirinal Flamen and the Veſtal Virgins were forced to carry the Sacred things, taking every one a ſhare of the burthen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now pals'd the <hi>Sublician</hi> Bridge, and ready to deſcend the Rock that leads to <hi>Janiculum;</hi> they were ſpied by <hi>Alvanius,</hi> who was driving a Cart wherein he had put his Wife and Children, who no ſooner ſaw them in that condition, but regarding publick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more than private Charity, commanded them to alight; and then placing the Holy things, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Veſtal to get in, he left his own intended Journey, and drave them till he came to the Town of <hi>Caere;</hi> where, becauſe they were curteouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently received, we teſtifie our thanks, and honour the memory of their Humanity: for thence it came to be inſtituted, that thoſe Sacred Rites were called Ceremonies, becauſe the <hi>Ceretans</hi> worſhipped and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them as well in the low as flouriſhing ſtate of the Commonwealth: And that Mean and Country Cart, on a ſudden the receptacle of ſo much Honour, came to equal, if not out-vie, the glory of a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Chariot.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. About the ſame time, memorable was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of obſerv'd Religion which <hi>Caius Fabius Dorſo</hi> gave us: for when the <hi>Gauls</hi> beſieged the Capitol, leſt the accuſtomed Sacrifice of the <hi>Fabii</hi> ſhould be put by, clad in a <hi>Gabin</hi> habit, and carrying the Sacred things in his hands and upon his ſhouldiers, he at length paſs'd through the midſt of the Enemy to the Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Hill, where having performed what was to be done, he returned to the Capitol with Divine Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41263:11"/>of his victorious Atchievement, as if he had been a Victor indeed.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Great alſo was the care of preſerving Religion among our Anceſtors, where <hi>Publius Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Baebius Tamphilus</hi> were Conſuls: For the Labourers that were digging a Field of <hi>Petillius</hi> the Scribe, at the foot of <hi>Janiculum,</hi> delving ſomewhat deeper than ordinary, found two little Stone-cheſts; in one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was a Writing, declaring, That it was the body of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> Son of <hi>Pomponius:</hi> In the other were ſeven Books in the Latine Tongue, treating of the right of the High-Prieſt; and as many in Greek, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of Wiſdom. For the preſervation of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Books they took eſpecial care; but the Greek one, (for there ſeemed to be ſome things therein prejudicial to their Religion) <hi>Lucius Petillius</hi> the Pretor by decree of Senate caus'd to be burnt in a publick Fire made by the Officers belonging to the Sacrifices: for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Romans</hi> could not endure that any thing ſhould be reſerved in the City, which might he a means to draw the minds of men from the worſhip of the Gods.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the King caus'd <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> the <hi>Duumvir</hi> to be fow'd in a Sack after the antient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to be thrown into the Sea, for that he had for a Bribe delivered to <hi>Petronius Sabinus</hi> a certain Book containing the Myſteries of the Civil Sacred things committed to his keeping.

                     <p n="14">14. But as to thoſe things which concern the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Religion, I know not whether <hi>Atilius Regulus</hi> have not excelled all that ever went before him, who of a famous Conquerour being now become a Captive, through the wiles and ambuſhments of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> he was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41263:11"/>to the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to try if he could get himſelf, being but one, and old, redeemed for ſeveral young and noble <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> who when he came, adviſed the Senate to the contrary, and went back to <hi>Carthage,</hi> well knowing to what cruel and inveterate Enemies he returned; but he had ſworn ſo to do, if he could not obtain the releaſe of their Captives. Surely the Immortal Gods had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have mitigated their fury; but that the glory of <hi>Atilius</hi> might be the greater, they permitted the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagians</hi> to take their own inhumane courſes: As they who in the third <hi>Punick</hi> War would ſeverely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the death of ſo noble a Soul with the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their City.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. How much more religious toward the Gods did our Senate ſhew themſelves? which, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal overthrow of <hi>Cannae,</hi> decreed that no women ſhould mourn longer than thirty days, to the end the Rites of <hi>Ceres</hi> might be by them performed. For now the greateſt part of the men lying ſlain upon the bloody accurſed Earth, there was no Family in the City that did not partake of the general Calamity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mothers and Daughters, Wives and Siſters of the ſlain were compelled to put off their Mourning-weeds, and put on their White-garments, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the office of Prieſts.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="5">5. The obſervation of Omens was certainly the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> at what time he was adjudged an Enemy by the Senate, lying at the houſe of one <hi>Fannia</hi> at <hi>Minturnae</hi> for his ſecurity: For he obſerved an Aſs-colt when he gave him Meat, that neglecting that, he ran ſtill to the water. At which ſight thinking that what was now offered by the Providence of the Gods, was to be followed, being himſelt otherwiſe very skilful in Religious Interpretations, he deſired of the Multitude that came to his aid, that he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Sea: and ſo getting aboard a little Ship, he ſailed into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo avoided the Victorious Arms of <hi>Sylla.</hi>

                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p>OF Prodigies alſo, whether proſperous or unluckly, it is no way from our purpoſe to diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. While <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> was an Infant and aſleep, his Attendants beheld a flame upon his head; which Prodigy <hi>Tanaquil</hi> the Wiſe of <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41263:18"/>ſhe brought up <hi>Servius,</hi> who was the Son of a Servant, inſtead of her own Son, and advanced him to the Throne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Equal happineſs in Event did that flame promiſe which blaz'd upon the head of <hi>Lucius Marcius,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the two Armies, which the deaths of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>Cn. Scipio</hi>'s had much weakned in <hi>Spain,</hi> while he was ſpeaking to his Souldiers: for upon the ſight of that, the Souldiers before fearful, now encouraged to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their wonted Fortitude, with the ſlaughter of 38000 men, and a great number of Priſoners, they took two Camps of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> crammed with ſpoil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo when after a long and ſharp War the <hi>Veii</hi> could not be taken, though beſieg'd within their own Walls, and that the delay was no leſs terrible to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers than the beſieged, the Gods themſelves open'd the way to an unexpected Victory: for on a ſudden the Lake <hi>Albanus,</hi> neither augmented by any ſhowers, nor aſſiſted by the inundation of any other Stream, roſe far above its uſual hight. To know the reaſon whereof, Meſſengers were ſent to the Oracle at <hi>Delphos,</hi> who brought for anſwer, <hi>That they ſhould let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that over ſwelled the Lake into the Fields: For ſo the</hi> Veii <hi>would come into the power of the</hi> Romans. Which before the Meſſengers could bring back, a Southſayer of the <hi>Veii,</hi> taken by one of our Souldiers and brought into the Camp, had alſo declared; ſo that the Senate double admoniſhed, both obey'd the Gods, and got poſſeſſion of the City.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor was this which follows an Omen of bad ſucceſs: <hi>Lucius Sulla</hi> Pro-Conſul in the Confederate War, while he was ſacrificing before the <hi>Pretorium</hi> in the Country of <hi>Nolas,</hi> on a ſudden beheld a Snake glide from the lower part of the Altar; at the ſight whereof, by the advice of <hi>Poſthumus</hi> the Southſayer, he led forth his Army, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41263:19"/>got the ſtrong Camp of the <hi>Samnites:</hi> which Victory was the firſt foundation and ſtep to his future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chiefly to be admired are thoſe Prodigies which hapned in our City, <hi>P. Volumnius</hi> and <hi>Ser. Sulpitius</hi> being Conſule. An Ox his Lowing being chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Humane Speech, exerciſed the minds of all people with the ſtrangeneſs of the Accident.

                  <p>In <hi>Picenum</hi> it rain'd Stones. In <hi>Gaul</hi> a Woolf came and took a Sword out of the Centinels Scabbard.

                  <p n="7">7. The headlong obſtinacy of <hi>Caius Flaminius, C. Hoſtilius Mancinus</hi> followed with a vain obſtinacy, to whom theſe Prodigies hapned as he was going Conſul for <hi>Spain.</hi> Being reſolv'd to ſacrifice at <hi>Lavinium,</hi> the Pullets being let out of the Bin, flew to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Wood, and though ſought for with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence imaginable, could never be found: And when he was about to go abroad in the Port of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whither he went afoot, he heard a ſtrange Voice, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Stay,</hi> Mancinus: With which affrighted, and in his return putting into <hi>Genoa,</hi> and there going aboard a little Boat, a Snake of a prodigious bigneſs appeared, and ſuddenly vaniſhed out of ſight. Which three Prodigies he equalled with the number of Calamities which befell him; an unfortunate Battel, a ſhameful Truce, and a moſt diſmal Surrender.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſad Event of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> a moſt dangerous Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who being an inconſiderate perſon, and being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd, would take no advice or counſel, makes his raſhneſs leſs to be wondered at: For when being Pro-Conſul, he was ſacrificing among the <hi>Lucans,</hi> two Snakes on a ſudden creeping out of ſome hidden place, having eaten the Liver of the Beaſt which he had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, retir'd to their lurking holes. And whereas by reaſon of this accident the Sacrifice was renew'd, the ſame Prodigy happen'd again. The third Sacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, and the Entrails more diligently lookt to, neither could the Serpents be driven away when they came, nor be hinder'd in their flight; which though as the Southſayers affirm'd, it ſignified that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was to be careful of his own ſafety, yet was not <hi>Gracchus</hi> ſo careful, but that by the treachery of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> at whoſe houſe he lay, he was drawn to a place where <hi>Mago</hi> hid himſelf with an armed power, who ſlew him naked and without defence.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41263:20"/>
                  <p>The misfortune of the Conſuls, equal Errour, and an end not differing from that of <hi>Titus Gracchus,</hi> draws me to the memory of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> He inflam'd with the glory of having taken <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and firſt of any driven <hi>Hannibal</hi> from the Walls of <hi>Nola,</hi> having reſolv'd either to overthrow the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> or at leaſt to drive um out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and to that end pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing with a moſt ſolemn Sacrifice to inquire into the will and pleaſure of the Gods; The firſt Beaſt that was ſlain before the fire, the Liver was found without a head; the next had a Liver with a double head: which being view'd, the Southſayer with a ſad countenance ſaid, <hi>That the Entrails did not pleaſe him:</hi> the firſt were altogether bad, the ſecond were not ſo good. Thus <hi>Marcellus</hi> being admoniſh'd not to do any thing raſhly, the next night adventuring to go out with a few men to view the Enemies Camp, environ'd by a multitude of his Enemies in the Country of the <hi>Brutii,</hi> by his death occaſion'd much ſorrow and detriment to his Country.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As for <hi>Octavius</hi> the Conſul, as he feared a moſt direful Omen, ſo he could not avoid it; for finding the head of the Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> broken, and ſo pitch'd in the ground that it could not be pull'd up, being at that time in Arms againſt his Colleague <hi>Cinna,</hi> he from thence prognoſticated his own ruine; in the midſt of which fear he came to a ſad end, and then the fix'd head of the Image was eaſily ſet in its place.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Nor muſt we paſs over in ſilence <hi>Marcus Craſſus,</hi> who is to be reckon'd one of the greateſt loſſes of our Empire, who was warn'd by many and moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able blows of Fate, before ſo great a ruine.</p>
                  <p>As he was drawing his Army out of <hi>Carrae</hi> againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he had a mourning Garment brought him; whereas they ſhould have brought him either a white or a purple Robe, when he was going to battle.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41263:20"/>The Souldiers march'd ſad and ſilent to their places, whereas they were wont to run with loud acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: One of the Eagles could ſcarcely be pull'd up out of the ground; the other being pull'd up, turn'd it ſelf the quite contrary way to which it ought to have been carried. Theſe Prodigies were very great, but the Calamities of the overthrow were far greater; the ſlaughter of ſo many fair Legions, ſo many Enſignes, ſo much of the glory and beauty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia trodden to the ground by the Horſe-men of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> hopeful Young men beſprinkled with the bloud of their Parents, and the body of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander among the promiſcuous heaps of the Slain, thrown a common Prey to the Fowls of the air. I wiſh I could ſpeak what were more delightful; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the truth. Thus the Gods contemn'd, become fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their Anger; thus the Counſels of men are chaſtized, when they think to outbrave Celeſtial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For the mighty <hi>Jove</hi> had abundantly warn'd <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> that he ſhould not try the utmoſt hazard of War with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> caſting his Lightning full in the faces of his Battalions marching from <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> covering his Enſigns with ſwarms of Bees, affrighting his whole Army with Nocturnal Terrours, and the flight of the Sacrifices from the Altars: But the Laws of invincible neceſſity would not ſuffer a mind, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remote enough from folly, to weigh thoſe Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies with a due conſideration. And therefore while he extols his large Power, his Wealth above private uſe, and all thoſe Ornaments which from his Youth he had contracted even to Envy, in the ſpace of one day he loſt um all. In the Temples of the Gods, the Statues turn'd of themſelves. Such a noiſe of men ſhouting, ſuch clattering of Arms, was heard at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochia</hi> and <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> that the Souldiers ran to the Walls:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41263:21"/>Such a noiſe of Drums in the moſt ſecret places of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus:</hi> in the Temple of Victory a Palm ſuddenly ſprang up under the Statue of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in the Pavement between the Stones.

                  <p>NOw becauſe I have touched upon the Riches of <hi>Midas,</hi> and the Eloquence of <hi>Plato,</hi> I will ſhew you how the quiet and ſafety of many men has been ſhadowed out under ſeveral repreſentations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And where ſhall I ſooner begin, than from the moſt ſacred memory of Divine <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> His Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Artorius</hi> being aſleep, the night before the day wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> fought one againſt the other in the fields of <hi>Philippi,</hi> the appearance of <hi>Minerva</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him to warn <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> then lying very ill, that not withſtanding his ſickneſs he ſhould not abſtain from the Battel: Which <hi>Caeſar</hi> hearing, caus'd himſelf to be carried in a Litter into the Field, where, while be laboured above his ſtrength for the Victory, his Camp was taken by <hi>Brutus.</hi> What other can we think then,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41263:22"/>but the Divine Benevolence ſo ordain'd it, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage deſtined to immortality, ſhould not be ſubject to a Fate unworthy his Divinity?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor was it onely the Dream of <hi>Artorius</hi> that gave warning to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who had a natural perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacity and vigour to judge of every thing, as a freſh and domeſtick Preſident: For he had heard that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purnia</hi> the Wiſe of his Parent <hi>Julius,</hi> the laſt night that he lived upon earth, dream'd that ſhe ſaw her Husband lie ſtabbed and bleeding in her boſom; and being affrighted with the ſtrangeneſs of the Dream, was an earneſt ſuiter to him to abſtain from going to the Senate the next day: but he, leſt he ſhould have been thought to have been mov'd with a womans dream, went the rather to the Senate-houſe, where the Murtherers quickly laid violent hands upon him. It is not needful to make any compariſon between the Father and the Son, both equal in their Divinity: for the one had made way for himſelf to Heaven by his own works, the other was to let the world enjoy his Vertues a long time. Therefore the Gods were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing that the firſt ſhould know the approaching change, which the other was to defer; it being enough that one Honour ſhould be given to Heaven, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Admirable alſo was that Dream, and famous in the Event, which the two Conſuls <hi>Decius Mus,</hi> and <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> dream'd, when they lay incamped not far from the foot of the Mountain <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Latin</hi> War, which was very ſharp and dangerous: For a certain perſon foretold to both of them, that the <hi>Manes</hi> and <hi>Terra Mater</hi> claim'd as their due the General of one ſide, and the whole Army on the other: But that which Captain ſoever ſhould aſſail the forces of the Enemy, and devote himſelf a Victim for the good of his Army, ſhould obtain the Victory.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41263:23"/>This the Entrails of the Sacrifices confirmed the next morning to both Conſuls, who endeavoured either to expiate the misfortune, if it might be averted, or elſe reſolv'd to undergo the determination of the Gods. Therefore they agreed, that which Wing ſhould begin to faint, the other ſhould with his own life appeaſe the Fates, which while both undauntedly ventured to perform, <hi>Decius</hi> hapned to be the perſon whom the Gods required.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Dream which follows, ſeems to concern publick Religion. A certain Maſter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Nor muſt we paſs over in ſilence, that when <hi>M. Cicero</hi> was baniſhed the City, by the Conſpiracy of his Enemies, He diverting himſelf in a certain Village in the Country of <hi>Atinate,</hi> and falling aſleep in the field,

                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>C. Gracchus</hi> was moſt openly and apparently foretold, in a Dream, the miſchief of an approaching miſchance: for being aſleep, he ſaw the ſhape of his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> who told him, <hi>There was no way for him to avoid the ſame Fate which he had undergone, when he was driven out of the Capitol.</hi> This many related from the mouth of <hi>Gracchus</hi> himſelf, before he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p n="1">1. SO high a Love had all our Anceſtors for their Countrey, that there was not a Senator, who for many Ages would reveal the Tranſactions of the Fathers. <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus</hi> onely, and he alſo through imprudence, going into the Countrey and meeting <hi>P. Craſſus</hi> by the way, told him what was done in order to proclaiming the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War, remembring that he had been Queſtor three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and not knowing that he was not yet put into the Senate by the Cenſors, who were the only perſons that gave admittance to thoſe that had born Honours in that Aſſembly. However, though this were but a harmleſs errour in <hi>Fabius,</hi> yet he was ſeverely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for it by the Conſuls. For they would by no means ſuffer Taciturnity, the beſt and ſafeſt bond of Government, to be violated in the leaſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of <hi>Aſia</hi> gave intelligence to the Senate, that <hi>Perſeus</hi> was preparing to make War, it could not be known either what <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſaid, or what the Fathers anſwered, till <hi>Perſeus</hi> was taken.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41263:35"/>The Court was the faithful and deep breaſt of the Commonwealth, environ'd and fortifi'd with Silence; which they that enter'd, ſoon caſt off private Love, cloathing themſelves with publick Zeal. So that I may ſay, that one would have thought, that no man heard what was committed to the ears of ſo many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But our antient Magiſtrates how they behaved themſelves in bearing up the Majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, from hence may be obſerved, that among all their other marks of Gravity, this they punctually maintain'd, not to talk with the <hi>Greeks</hi> but in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. And alſo cauſing them to lay aſide the volubility of their own language, forc'd them to ſpeak by an Interpreter, not only in our own City, but in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> That the honour of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue might be ſpread with greater veneration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Nations. Not but that they had their Schools of Learning, but that they did not hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that the Gown ſhould in any thing be ſubject to the Cloak. Believing it a poor and low thing, that the weight and authority of Government ſhould be tam'd by the charms of Eloquence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore, <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> thou art not to be condemn'd of clowniſh Rigour, not to let thy old age, crown'd with a double Lawrel, illuſtrious with <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> Trohies, be ſoftned and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Eloquence of a vanquiſh'd Nation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, leſt while he appear'd a forrainer in the exerciſes of his Wit, he might ſeem a Runagate from his native Rites and Cuſtomes. Who therefore open'd the way to the <hi>Greek</hi> Pleadings that now deafen our ears? <hi>Molo</hi> the Rhetorician, as I am perſwaded, who likewiſe ſharpned the ſtudies of <hi>M. Cicero.</hi> For he was the firſt Stranger that was ever heard in the Senate without an Interpreter; which Honour he receiv'd not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, having mainly advanc'd the force of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41263:36"/>Eloquence. Of conſpicuous felicity is <hi>Arpinum,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you reſpect the one as a great contemner of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the other as the abounding Fountain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With great diligence this Cuſtome alſo was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by our Anceſtors, that no perſon might walk between the Conſul and the laſt Lictor, though he went along by vertue of his Office, unleſs he were a Child and the Son of the Conſul. Which Cuſtome was ſo obſtinately maintain'd, that <hi>Q. Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> five times Conſul, and beſides in prime Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and honour'd with Age, being requeſted to go between him and the Lictor, for fear of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the crowd of <hi>Samnites,</hi> with whom he was going to treat, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t refus'd the Courteſie. The like did that ſame <hi>Fabius</hi> when he was ſent by the Senate to his Son Conſul at <hi>Sueſſa.</hi> For as his Son was diſpatching Cauſes without the City, he took his Horſe to ride through the preaſe; but his Son ſeeing him afar off, ſent a Lictor to him, commanding him to alight and come afoot, if he had any thing to ſay to the Conſul. Whom <hi>Fabius</hi> readily obeyed, ſaying, <hi>Son, I did not this in contempt of thy Authority, but only to try whether thou kneweſt how to behave thy ſelf like a Conſul or no: Nor am I ignorant what is my Duty to my Countrey; but I prefer publike Inſtitutions before private Piety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="7">7. We are likewiſe to remember, that it was not lawful for the Tribunes of the people to be admitted into the Senate; but being plac'd upon Seats before the Doors, there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſuch honour they gave to Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that many times the Debts of thoſe that had well behaved themſelves in the government of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, were paid by the Senate: For they eſteemed it an unworthy thing, that the dignity of thoſe men ſhould ſuffer at home, by whoſe induſtry the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had obtained ſplendor abroad.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This Cuſtome confirm'd by long uſe, <hi>C. Marius</hi> firſt brake, making Souldiers of thoſe that were tax'd by Pole. A noble Citizen, yet by the Novelty which he brought in, not ſo propitious to Antiquity. Not unmindful, that if Military Sloath ſhould perſiſt to deſpiſe humility, he himſelf might be deem'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ceſs'd by the Pole. Therefore he thought it beſt to obliterate that proud way of choice among the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, leſt the contagion of that mark ſhould ſpread it ſelf to the obſcuring his own glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Diſcipline of handling Arms was recommended to the Souldiers by <hi>P. Rutilius</hi> Conſul, Colleague with <hi>Cn. Mallius:</hi> For not following the example of any Commander before him, calling together the Teachers of the Gladiators, from the Plays of <hi>Cn.

                  <p n="3">3. For Five Hundred Fifty Eight years, the Senate ſtood mixt among the common People to behold the publick Shews. But this cuſtome <hi>Atilius Serranus</hi> and <hi>L.

                  <p n="4">4. Now I ſhall rehearſe the beginning and firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Inſtitution of Playes. In the time that <hi>Sulpitius Peticus</hi> and <hi>Licinius Stolo</hi> were Conſuls, a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Peſtilence had afflicted our City, then at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, with new cares of preſervation from inteſtine calamity: And there was no help in any humane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, all reliance was upon the ſtrict and new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Religion. Nor would the favour of the Gods lend any ear to the Verſes compos'd for their atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until the time which <hi>Romulus,</hi> upon his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins, conſecrated with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Feſtivals, which he called <hi>Conſualia.</hi> Now as it is the cuſtome of men to purſue ſmall beginnings with an ardent affection, the young men added geſture to the pious and reverent words which they us'd towards the Gods, though with a ruſtick and uncompos'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Bodies. Which occaſioned the calling of <hi>Ludius</hi> out of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> whoſe comely ſwiftneſs after the manner of the <hi>Curetes</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> from whom the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> had their Original, was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Novelty to the eyes of the <hi>Romans:</hi> and becauſe <hi>Ludius</hi> was among them called <hi>Hiſtrio,</hi> therefore all Players were afterwards called <hi>Hiſtriones.</hi> At length the Diſcipline of praying advanced it ſelf to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41263:39"/>pleaſe um having injur'd his Voice, at length by the aſſiſtance of a Boy and a Muſician perform'd his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in quiet: for he alwaies acted his own Works him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The <hi>Attellans</hi> were call'd in by the <hi>Oſci;</hi> which ſort of recreation being temper'd by the <hi>Italian</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, continued without any blemiſh; for they were neither remov'd from their Tribe, nor debarr'd of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Stipends.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And becauſe it appears by their names whence the other Plaies had their derivation, it may not ſeem abſurd to relate the beginning of the <hi>Secular</hi> Games, the knowledg whereof is leaſt certain. At what time the City and Country was afflicted with a moſt violent Peſtilence, one <hi>Valeſius</hi> a certain rich man, who led a countrey life, his two Sons and his Daughter being all deſperately ſick, as he was reaching ſome hot water for um from the fire, kneeling on his knees, pray'd his familiar Houſhold-gods that they would turn the evil from his Children upon his own head. Preſently he heard a voice, which told him his Children ſhould recover, if he would carry them down the River <hi>Tiber</hi> to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and there refreſh them with hot water from the Altar of <hi>Dis</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> Being troubled at this Prediction, becauſe it was a long and dangerous Voyage; yet hope overcoming his preſent fear, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Children to the Banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> (for he lived in a houſe of his own, in a Village call'd <hi>Eretum,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Countrey of the <hi>Sabines</hi>) and in a little Veſſel ſayling to <hi>Oſtia,</hi> he put in about the middle of the Night at the Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> At which time the Children being thirſty, and there being no means to relieve um, for that there was no fire in the Veſſel, the Pilot told him, that he had diſcovered a ſmoak not far off. Who thereupon being commanded to go aſhore to <hi>Terentum,</hi> that was the name of the place, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily took a Cup, which aſſoon as he had fill'd out of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41263:39"/>the River in that place where the ſmoak aroſe, he return'd very chearful, believing that now he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the footſteps of a Remedy ſent from Heaven, and in a field that rather ſeem'd to ſmoak than have any reliques of fire; getting ſuch fuel as by chance he met with, and ſtedfaſtly purſuing the Omen, with continual blowing, he kindled a fire, and brought warm water to the Children. Which they had no ſooner drank off, but falling into a quiet ſleep, they ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recover'd of their diſtemper. Waking, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to their Father, that they had ſeen they knew not what gods, which wip'd their Skins with a Sponge, and commanded them that they ſhould offer Sacrifices of black Beaſts at the Altar of <hi>Dis</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> where the Potion of water was firſt brought them, making withal Nocturnal Plays and Tables covered. The Father, becauſe he ſaw no Altar there, believing that it was expected that he ſhould build one, went to the City to buy one, leaving upon the place certain Workmen to dig the foundation.

Coming to viſit his Colleague that was ſick, and none of the Nobles, of which the Room was full, riſing to let him ſit, he commanded his Seat of Office to be brought him; and ſo in vindication of his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſcorn of their Contempt, ſate down.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The examination of Witchcraft, formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Cuſtoms and Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> came to be in uſe upon the detection of ſeveral Crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by certain ancient Matrons; who having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly poyſon'd their Husbands, being at length diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by a Maid-ſervant, above an hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſuffer'd death.</p>

The Colledge of Muſicians drew the eyes of the common people upon them, being wont upon private and publick Spectacles to play in Conſort, in vary-colour'd Habits and Maſques. From thence they took farther liberty. Of old being forbid to diet in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which was the antient Cuſtome, in great diſcontent they retired to <hi>Tibur.</hi> But the Senate not brooking the want of their ſervice at the ſacred Feſtivals, by their Ambaſſadors requeſted of the <hi>Tiburtines,</hi> that they would ſend um back to <hi>Rome.</hi> They refuſing to go, the <hi>Tiburtines</hi> invited um to a

When they were return'd, they were reſtor'd to their former honour, and their priviledges of Play granted them. They us'd Masks, being aſham'd of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumvented in drink.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The plain Diet of the Antients was a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of their Humanity and Continency. For then the greateſt men took it for no diſcredit to Dine and Sup in open view. Nor had they any Banquets which they were aſham'd to conceal from the eyes of the People. They were ſo addicted to Continence, that the uſe of Pulſe was more frequent than Bread. And therefore that Cake, which was us'd in their Sacrifices, was made only of Barley and Salt. The Entrails were ſprinkled with Barley; and they fed the Pullets whence they took their Omens, with Pulſe. For of old, they thought the Offerings of their Diet, by how much the plainer it was, ſo much the more efficacious to appeaſe the Gods.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Other Gods they ador'd, that they might do them good. But to the Diſeaſe <hi>Feaver</hi> they built a Temple, that ſhe might do them the leſs hurt.

THe City of <hi>Sparta</hi> follow'd the ſame Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neareſt to the Gravity of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: who continuing for ſome years moſt obedient to the ſevere Laws of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> would by no means permit the eyes of their Citizens to behold the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Aſia;</hi> leſt being tempted with the Allurements of that Countrey, they ſhould degenerate into a volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Life. For they had heard that all manner of Exceſs, all kind of unneceſſary Pleaſures did there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41263:42"/>And that the <hi>Ionians</hi> were the firſt that uſed Anointing and giving Crowns and Garlands at Feaſts, and brought up the cuſtome of a Second Courſe, no ſmall incitements to Luxury. And it is no wonder, that men delighting in Labour and Patience, would not that the moſt indiſſoluble Nerves of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhould be weakned and broken by the contagion of forreign Delicacies: finding it eaſier to decline from Vertue to Luxury, than to recede from Luxury to Vertue. Which that it was no vain fear of theirs, their Captain <hi>Pauſanias</hi> made apparent, who after he had perform'd great Actions, was not aſham'd to ſuffer his Fortitude to be ſoftned with the effeminate Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Apparel of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Armies of the ſame City were never wont to joyn Battle, till they had heated their Courage with the ſound of their Flutes, whoſe Tunes went all in <hi>Anapaeſtic</hi> meaſures, whereby they were taught to aſſail: their Enemies with ſmart and thick Blows. They alſo were wont to uſe Scarlet Coats, to hide the Blood of their Wounds. Not that the ſight thereof was any terror to them, but that their Enemies ſhould gain no heart or Courage thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

Then as the Poyſon ſeized her particular parts, ſhe told us; and when ſhe found it approaching to her Bowels and Heart, ſhe call'd her Daughters to do their laſt Duty of cloſing her Eyes.

For the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> thought it a crime to ſurvive in Battle, when any Friend was ſlain, for whoſe preſervation he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted his life.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But the People of <hi>Thrace</hi> deſervedly challenge to themſelves the praiſe of Wiſdome, who at the Birth of Children weep, at the Funerals of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; taught by no other Precepts than the true condition of Human Nature. And therefore, let all Creatures but extinguiſh in themſelves the love of Life, which compels them to act and ſuffer many ugly things, eſpecially when it lies in their power to make a happy and bleſſed end of living.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41263:45"/>they ſhould throw away all things whatſoever which they had about them, that was only for bravery and pleaſure, and otherwife unneceſſary. Whereupon there were above two thouſand Whores, Sutlers and Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters turn'd out of the Camp. Upon which the Army, being clear'd of all that luggage and filth, that lately for fear of death had ſham'd themſelves with an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Truce, now refreſh'd, and recovering new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and courage, in a ſhort time laid the fierce and haughty <hi>Numantium</hi> level with the ground.

Nor did he aim at particular parts, but immediately reduced the whole into Order. Firſt he remov'd the Sutlers out of the Camp, and forbid Meat ready dreſt to be fold. He permitted none of the Souldiers to have Servants or Horſes to carry their Arms, or to fetch or provide um Victuals. Then he changed the place of the Camp, and fortified himſelf in the ſame manner, as if <hi>Jugurth</hi> had been at hand, with Ditch and Breaſt-work. Now what was the event of Continence reſtored, and Industry revived? It obtain'd frequent Victories, and innumerable Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies from that Enemy, whoſe back under an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Commander, it had not been the good fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers to ſee before.</p>

For I am certain, thine eyes, orewhelm'd with darkenſs in the brighteſt light, could not behold the great work of thy mind. But thou <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> Conſul in the <hi>Latine</hi> War, didſt command thy Son to be carried away by the Officer, and to be ſlain like a Sacrifice, though he obtain'd a noble Victory, for that he had preſum'd to fight with <hi>Geminius Metius</hi> Captain of the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> when provoked to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat by him. Eſteeming it better, that a Father ſhould want a couragious Son, than thy Countrey want Military Diſcipline.</p>

A ſpectacle of wonder to behold <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, and a victorious General, his Cloaths pull'd off, his Body naked, to be lacerated with the ſtripes of an Executioner, to no other end than to ſprinkle the glorious honour of his Victories, ſo lately obtain'd, with the freſh Blood of thoſe Wounds, which he had received in the Field, drawn from his Body by the knotted ſtripes of the <hi>Lictor.</hi> At length the Army, mov'd by his Prayers, gave him the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of flying into the City, where in vain he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the aid of the Senate; for <hi>Papirius</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſever'd in requiring his puniſhment, Wherefore his Father, after having been Dictator, and three times Conſul, was compell'd to appeal to the People, and upon his Knees to beg the aſſiſtance of the Tribunes in the behalf of his Son. Neither by this means could the Severity of <hi>Papirius</hi> be reſtain'd; but being intreated by the whole City, and by the Tribunes themſelves, made a proteſtation, that he forgave the Puniſhment mot to <hi>Fabius,</hi> but to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Authority of the Tribunes.</p>

Thus to his great honour did <hi>Piſo</hi> revenge the great diſhonour of his Countrey, having brought it ſo to paſs, that they who out of a deſire of Life, and deſerving to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, had ſuffer'd their Arms to become the Trophies of Fugitives, and were not aſhamed to permit the ignominious youk of Servitude to be laid upon their Liberty by the hands of Slaves, might experience the bitter enjoyment of Life, and covet that Death which they had ſo effeminately avoided.</p>

To take Cities, conquer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lay violent hands on Kingdoms, unleſs there be Reverence, Juſtice and Honour in the Courts of Law and Council? For unleſs that be, Riches hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped unto the SKy will have no ſtable Foundation.

                  <p>THere is alſo that Majeſty among Illuſtrious Men, as it were a private Cenſorſhip, without the Honour of Tribunals, without the attendance of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, powerful in the obtaining of Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For what greater Honour could be given to any one, than what was given to <hi>Metellus,</hi> though he ſtood
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41263:55"/>accus'd of a Crime. For when he pleaded for himſelf upon a charge of Bribery, and his Accompts were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Accuſers, and were brought forth to be inſpected, the whole Council refuſed to look upon them, leſt they ſhould ſeem to doubt of the truth of any thing that was therein contained. For the Judges lookt upon the Life of ſo great a man, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had prudently adminiſtred the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And though it an unworthy thing, to balance a little Wax and a few Writings with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of ſo famous a Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what wonder, that due honour was given to <hi>Metellus</hi> by his Fellow-citizens, which an enemy did not refrain to render to the Elder <hi>Africanus?</hi> For <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> in the War which he made againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> having taken his Son Priſoner, not onely honourably entertained him, but alſo ſent him to his Father, laden with Royal Gifts, though he were then almoſt driven out of his Kingdom by him. But the enraged King rather choſe to reverence the Majeſty of ſo great a man, than revenge his own misfortune. To the ſame <hi>Africanus</hi> being retired to his Country-houſe in the Village of <hi>Liternium,</hi> ſeveral Captains of Pirates being in the ſame place, came to ſee him: He believing they came to do him ſome miſchief, placed a Guard of his Domeſtick Servants upon the top of his houſe, being well prepared with force and courage to beat them off. Which when the ſaid Captains perceived, immediately ſending back their Souldiers, and throwing their Arms away, they approach to the Lord, declaring themſelves to be his friends, requeſting the ſight and company of ſo great a man, as it had been a favour from Heaven, and deſiring him to vouchſafe them the ſecure ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his greatneſs. Which words when the Servants related to <hi>Scipio,</hi> he commanded the doors to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd, and the Captains to be let in; who reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41263:55"/>the Threſhold as it had been ſome ſacred Altar, or Religious Temple, with great eagerneſs approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kiſs his hands. And after they had ſpent a long time in admiration of him, leaving great Gifts in the Porch, ſuch as they us'd to offer to the Immortal Gods, they departed to their Ships. What could be more noble than this effect and fruit of Majeſty? What more pleaſing to behold or enjoy? His enemy appeas'd their wrath with admiration. His Preſence ſtupified the joyful eyes of the Pyrats. Should the Stars falling from Heaven offer themſelves to men, they could not be capable of greater adoration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This hapned to <hi>Scipio</hi> being alive; this other to <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> being dead. For when his Funerals were celebrated, and that by chance certain Princes of <hi>Macedon</hi> were then abiding at <hi>Rome</hi> as Embaſſadors to the Senate, they willingly offer'd themſelves to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Funeral Bed. Which will ſeem ſo much the greater Honour, conſidering that the forepart of the Bier was adorn'd with the Trophies of his <hi>Macedonian</hi> Conqueſts. For how great muſt be the honour which they give to <hi>Paulus,</hi> whom they would not refuſe to carry, with the Enſignes of their own calamity in the face of all the people! Which Spectacle added to his Funeral a reſemblance of another Triumph. For thus did <hi>Macedon</hi> render thee, O <hi>Paulus,</hi> illuſtrious twice in our City: by their Spoils, ſafe and victorious; venerable in his Death, by their Shoulders.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor was it a ſmall honour done to thy Son <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> whom thou giving in Adoption, wouldſt have to be the Ornament of two Families. For being but a Young-man, and ſent by <hi>Lucullus</hi> the Conſul out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> made him Arbitrator of the conditions of Peace, as if he had been Conſul and Emperour. <hi>Carthage</hi> ignorant of her Deſtiny: For that very glory

                  <p n="5">5. What more miſerable than Condemnation and Exile?

For the Slaughter of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> preſented it ſelf before his eyes; and the Calamity of his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd Nation quell'd his Courage.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The admiration alſo of the ſtout and vertuous Life of <hi>Percius Cato,</hi> render'd him ſo wonderful to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41263:56"/>Senate, who having prefix'd a day for the Publicans to anſwer, contrary to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s will, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his command carried by the Lictor to Priſon, the whole Senate was not aſhamed to follow him, which thing did not a little ſoften the perſeverance of his divine Soul.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. At another time, the ſame perſon beholding the Floral Plays which <hi>Meſſius</hi> the Aedil ſet forth, the people were aſhamed to require that the Mimicks ſhould appear naked; which when he underſtood from <hi>Favonius,</hi> his great friend, that ſate cloſe by him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Theatre, left his preſence ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the cuſtome of the Show. Whoſe departure the people loudly applauding, renewed the ancient cuſtome of Jeſting in the Scenes; confeſſing that they attributed more to the Majeſty of one man, than they claimed for the ſake of the Generality. To what Riches, to what Power, to what Triumphs, was this priviledge granted before? A ſmall Patrimony, Manners reſtrained within the bounds of Continence: a ſmall train of Followers, a houſe ſhut againſt Ambition: One Image of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Genealogy; not the moſt comely Aſpect, but a Vertue hightned with all perfections.

And laſtly, by his ſingle Strength was as great a guard to our City with his Shield, as <hi>Tibur</hi> with her Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.

                  <p n="7">7. Among theſe, Antiquity offers a moſt famous Example of Fortitude.

Yet at that moſt miſerable and calamitous ſeaſon, was not our City for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their priſtine Vertue: for though deprived of their Honour, they ſate with their doors open, in their Running-chairs, with the Habits of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy and Prieſthood, that in their night of ſorrow they might retain the Splendor and Ornaments of their paſt life, and might encourage the people more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to undergo the burthen of their Calamity. Their Aſpect was Venerable in the ſight of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were not a little moved at the Novelty of what they ſaw, conſidering the magnificence of their Ornaments, and their ſtrange kinde of boldneſs.

                  <p>FOrtitude hath been apparent to the eyes of men by the famous Deeds both of men and women: and by her incitement, Patience appears grounded upon as firm foundations, not being endued with a leſs generous Soul, but ſo like the one co the other, that ſhe ſeems to have received her birth either with her or from her.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For what has a greater reſemblance to what I have formerly related, than the Act of <hi>Mutius,</hi> who grieving to ſee our City vexed with a long and grievous

Certainly the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods never beheld with more heedful eyes any Offering made them. And it forced <hi>Porſenna</hi> himſelf, forgetful of the danger, to turn his Revenge into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. <hi>Return,</hi> quoth he, <hi>to thy own Friends, and tell them how I have given thee thy life for ſeeking mine.</hi> Whoſe Clemency <hi>Mutius</hi> no way flattering, more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee him live, than glad of his own life, return'd to the City with a ſirname of eternal glory, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Scaevola.</hi>

                     <p>According to the ancient Cuſtome of <hi>Greece,</hi> the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41263:68"/>moſt eminent Noblemens Sons did always attend upon King <hi>Alexander</hi> when he ſacrificed: Among which there was one who while he ſtood before the King, holding the Cenſer, a live cole fell upon his arm, which though it burnt his fleſh ſo vehemently that the ſtink thereof offended the noſtrils of all the ſtanders by, yet the Lad would by no means diſcover his pain, fearing to diſturb the Sacrifice by letting fall the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, or to offend the Kings ears by complaining. The King pleaſed with the patience of the Youth, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make a mere certain tryal thereof, prolong'd the Sacrifice beyond his wonted time; yet nothing would alter the conſtancy of the Lad. Had <hi>Darius</hi> caſt his eyes upon this wonder, he would have known that Souldiers of ſuch a race were not to be overcome, while in their tender age he beheld them endu'd with ſuch a ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>There is that vehement and conſtant Diſcipline of the Minde, I mean Philoſophy excelling in Learning, ruler of the venerable Myſteries of Doctrne, which being receiv'd into the breaſt of men, they preſently lay aſide all diſhoneſt and unworthy affections, and being armed with the true weapons of Vertue, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves above all fear and thought of pain.</p>

After ſome time obſerving that the Cuſtome of Dominion was more prevalent than wholſome Counſels, he ſtirr'd
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41263:68"/>up and inflam'd the minds of the moſt noble Youth with a deſire of recovering their Liberty. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reveal'd to the Tyrant, he call'd the People into the Market-place, and in their preſence began to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Zeno</hi> with moſt exquiſite torments; oftentimes asking him who were his Confederates in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. <hi>Zeno</hi> would name none of them, but only thoſe that were the Tyrants chiefeſt Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then upbraiding the <hi>Agrigentines</hi> with their ſloath and fear, rais'd ſuch a ſuddain commotion in their minds, that they fell upon the Tyrant and ſtoned him to death.

A Philoſopher of the ſame Name, being put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rack by <hi>Nearchus</hi> the Tyrant, whoſe Death he had conſpit'd, did not only appear a Conquerour of his pain and puniſhment in concealing his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, but ſhewed himſelf more covetous of revenge; and therefore telling the Tyrant that he had ſomething to declare, which it was fit that no body elſe ſhould hear, he was thereupon looſen'd from the Rack, and pretending to whiſper in the Tyrants ear, when he ſaw his time, caught his Ear in his Teeth, nor would let go, till with the loſs of his Life, the other had loſt a member of his body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> imitating the ſame Patience, and being put upon the Rack by <hi>Nicocreon,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> when he could by no means be reſtrain'd from caſting the moſt bitter taunts and reproaches imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable againſt the Tyrant, who at length threatned to cut out his Tongue; <hi>This part of my body neither,</hi> quoth he, <hi>effeminate Youngman, ſhall be in thy power:</hi> and preſently biting it off with his teeth, when he had

That tongue wonderfully aſtoniſh'd the ears of many, eſpecially of <hi>Alexander</hi> the King, having before ſo wiſely and eloquently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the condition of the Earth, the ſcituation of the Sea, the Motion of the Stars, and laſtly the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole World, Yet he fell more gloriouſly than he liv'd, ſeeing ſuch a couragious concluſion approv'd the illuſtriouſneſs of his profeſſion, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſuch a noble end. And <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> did not only not forſake living, but render'd his Death more famous.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In vain did <hi>Hieronymus</hi> the Tyrant weary the hands of the Executioners with the Tortures of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> a moſt eminent perſon. For the Tyrant was forced to break his Whips, looſen the Strings, take him from the Rack, and quench the burning Plates, ere he could make him confeſs his Confederates. At length, by accuſing one of the Tyrants Guard, upon whoſe ſhoulders as upon hinges the whole weight of the Government hung, he ſav'd one of his moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41263:74"/>Fourth year of his Age, proffer'd himſelf. Which confidence of his afforded both ſafety and victory to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And the ſame confidence he had at home, he us'd in <hi>Spain.</hi> For when he was beſieging the City of <hi>Badia,</hi> he caus'd all thoſe that came to his Tribunal, in matters of Law, to put in Sureties to appear at a certain Houſe which was within the Walls of the Town the next day; and immediately taking the City, at the ſame time and place that he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he caus'd his Chair to be plac'd, and there ſate in Judgment. Nothing more Heroic than ſuch a Confidence, nothing more true than ſuch a Prediction, nothing more efficacious than ſuch a Celerity, nothing more worthy than ſuch an Authority. Not leſs cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, nor leſs proſperous was his Paſſage into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi> into which he tranſported his Army, contrary to the command of the Senate. In which thing, had he not truſted more to his own opinion, than the counſel of the Conſcript Fathers, there would have been no end of the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War. Equal to this was that Confidence of his, that when after he was landed in <hi>Africa,</hi> he had taken ſeveral of the Scouts of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Army, he neither put them to death, nor in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor enquir'd any thing into the ſtate and condition of the Enemy; but caus'd them to be led through all the Companies of his Army: And then, after he had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k'd them whether they had taken a ſufficient view of what they were commanded to take notice of, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing proviſion to be given to them and their horſes, he freely diſmiſs'd us in ſafety. With which Confidence of mind he dampt the Courage of the Enemy, before he had vanquiſh'd their Arms. But to come to the private acts of his ſublime confidence; when he was call'd to an accompt for Fourty Thouſand Seſterces of the Money of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> he took the Book wherein his Expences were wrote down, and by which he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41263:74"/>might have clear'd himſelf from the Accuſation of his enemies, and tore it publickly; diſdaining that any doubt ſhould be made of what he had acted, as being the chief Commander: Pleading for himſelf in this wiſe; <hi>I am not to give an accompt to your Treaſury, moſt Noble Senators, having commanded a forreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which by my Government and Conduct, I have made more plentiful than twice an Hundred Thouſand Seſterces. Neither do I think ye are come to that height of malice, as to doubt of my Innocency. For when I had ſubdued</hi> Africa <hi>wholly under your Juriſdiction, I brought nothing thence that I could call mine own, but a Sirname. They have not therefore rendered me covetous of the</hi> Punic, <hi>nor my Brother of the</hi> Aſiatic <hi>Treaſure, ſeeing we are both more wealthy in Envy, than in Money.</hi> Which ſtout defence of <hi>Scipio</hi> the whole Senate approved.</p>
                  <p>Like this was another act of his. When finding that the urgent occaſions of the Common-wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Money to be taken out of the Publique Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and that the Queſtors were ſhie of opening it, becauſe it ſeem'd to be ſomething againſt the Law; being a private perſon he demanded the Keys, and compel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41263:75"/>moſt ſplendid Speech of his had as noble a ſucceſs. For immediately the whole Senate, the whole Order of Knight, and all the People follow'd him to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The Tribune remained alone to plead to the people without the people, being deſerted in the <hi>Forum</hi> with great contempt of his Calumny. At length, to avoid the ſhame, he went alſo to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol himſelf; and of an Accuſer, became a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> the famous Heir of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Courage and Magnanimity, being at the Siege of a ſtrong City, and perſwaded by ſome that he ſhould place round about the Walls thereof ſharp Iron Spikes, and ſtop all the open Paſſages with Planks covered with Lead, and ſtuck with Spikes, to hinder the Sallies of the Enemy; made anſwer, that it was not for him to fear thoſe that he ſought to take.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To what ever ſide of Memorable Examples I turn me, I am forced, <hi>nolens volens,</hi> to remain in the Family of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. For how can we in this place paſs over <hi>Scipio Naſica,</hi> illuſtrious for his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mind and Saying? There being a likelihood of great Scarcity, <hi>Curatius</hi> Tribune of the People compelled the Conſuls, in a publick Aſſembly, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in Court the buying of Corn, and ſending Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to that end and purpoſe. For the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which deſign, being of little profit, <hi>Naſica</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make oppoſition; upon which a great clamour ariſing among the People: Romans, ſaid he, <hi>be quiet, for I underſtand much better than you do, what the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Commonwealth require.</hi> Which words of his they no ſooner heard, but with a ſilence full of veneration, they made it appear, how much a greater reſpect they had to his Authority, than to their own want of Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſtout mind alſo of <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> is to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41263:75"/>be delivered to Eternal Memory; who, when he had defeated <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> and the Army of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> and that it was told him that the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Ligurians</hi> were without order, and without their Officers, ſcattered from their Colours, eaſie to be overthrown with a ſmall party; he made anſwer, That thoſe were to be ſpared, leſt the Enemy ſhould want Meſſengers of their great defeat at home.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This was a warlike preſence of minde, that which we relate, though in a perſon of the Gown, not leſs praiſeworthy; which <hi>Furius Philus</hi> ſhewed in the Senate: For he compelled <hi>Quintus Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Pompeius,</hi> men of Conſular degree, being his profeſſed Enemies, and upbraiding him becauſe he did not go into <hi>Spain,</hi> which province he had choſen, that he ſhould ſend Lieutenants thither, upon his departure from <hi>Rome</hi> to march along with him; a confidence not onely couragious, but almoſt raſh, that durſt admit ſo neer him two of his moſt Capital Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; and truſt the management of Affairs in the breaſt of Enemies, which was hardly to be intruſted with his friends.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The act of this perſon, if it be not diſpleaſing, certainly the purpoſe of <hi>L. Craſſus,</hi> who was the moſt Eloquent among his Anceſtors, cannot admit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: who having obtained the Province of <hi>Gallia</hi> in his Conſulſhip, in which Province <hi>Carbo</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd his Father, when he came to have an inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>Carbo</hi>'s actions, he not onely not remov'd him from his Dignity, but aſſign'd him a place in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and ordered nothing without his preſence in Council: So that ſharp and vehement <hi>Carbo</hi> got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his <hi>Gallick</hi> Expedition, but onely that he thereby underſtood that a guilty Father had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by a juſt and honeſt man.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Elder <hi>Cato</hi> being often called to plead for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41263:76"/>himſelf, yet never convicted of any Crime, at length repoſed ſo much confidence in his Innocency, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly queſtioned, he made <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Judge, to whom he bare a ſingular hatred, by which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Courage he abated the envy of his Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſame was the fortune of <hi>M. Scaurus,</hi> the ſame length of years, the ſame courage of minde: Who being accuſed before the Pulpits for Orations, that he had taken money of <hi>Mithridates</hi> to betray the Commonwealth, pleaded his Cauſe in this manner: <hi>It is unjuſt, O</hi> Romans, ſaid he, <hi>that I who have lived among one ſort of people, ſhould come to give an account of my actions among another; yet I will dare to ask ye all, the greateſt part of whom could not poſſibly be preſent at the Deeds which I have done, and the Honours which I have attain'd.</hi> Varius Suetonenſis <hi>ſays that</hi> M.

                  <p n="9">9. Contrariwiſe did <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> that Eloquent man: For he, not by refuſing, but by embracing his own defence, teſtified how innocent he was. Going Queſtor into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was on his Journey as far as <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſium;</hi> where being informed by Letters that he was accuſed of Inceſt before the Pretor <hi>Caſſius,</hi> whoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, becauſe of his ſeverity, was called the <hi>Rock of the Guilty,</hi> though he might have ſhun'd it by the benefit of the <hi>Memmian</hi> Law, which forbids the Names of them to be taken who are abſent upon the Affairs of the Publick, yet he return'd to the City; by which advice of a good Confidence, he not onely obtained a quick abſolution, but a honeſter departure.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Theſe that follow, are alſo ſplended Examples
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41263:76"/>of noble Confidence. For in that War which was undertaken againſt <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ſent a Navy of an Hundred and Thirty Ships to <hi>Oſtia,</hi> to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Senate were pleaſed to ſend Meſſengers with Inſtructions to tell their Captain, that they did not uſe to enter into Wars which they were not able to carry on without the help of Strangers; and that therefore he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with his Navy to <hi>Carthage.</hi> The ſame Senate ſome few years after, when the <hi>Roman</hi> power was almoſt broken by the Overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> ſent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of Forces to the Army in <hi>Spain;</hi> whereby they ſhew'd, that although <hi>Hannibal</hi> was with his Army at the <hi>Capene</hi> Gate, how little they valued his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Thus to carry themſelves in Adverſity, what was it elſe, but to compel Fortune, overcome with ſhame, to return to their ſide?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is a great leap to deſcend from the Senate to the Poet <hi>Accius.</hi> But that we may paſs from him more decently to forreign Examples, let us produce him. He, when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> a great and powerful man came into the Colledge of Poets, would not ſo much as riſe: not that he was forgetful of his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, but that he believed himſelf ſuperiour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their Studies. And therefore not guilty of the Crime of Inſolence, ſeeing the conteſt was about Volumes, not Statues.</p>

                  <p>THere remains the labour of Conſtancy, as it were due to him that has demonſtrated an open and couragious breaſt endued with good Confidence: For Nature has provided that whoever believes himſelf to have comprehended any thing orderly and rightly in his minde, ſhould ſtifly defend it, and put it into act againſt oppoſition; or if not done, ſhould bring it to effect without delay maugre all reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But while I ſeek for an Example of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, looking about me at a diſtance, before all the reſt, the Conſtancy of <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> offers it ſelf. He at that time held <hi>Capua,</hi> which through the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> had reſolv'd by their vile Revolt to put the Kingdom of <hi>Italy</hi> into the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours hands. Having therefore made a true value of the Enemies Crime, he purpoſed with himſelf wholly to extirpate the Senate of <hi>Capua,</hi> who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that wicked Decree. To this intent he ſent them all to <hi>Theana,</hi> and <hi>Calena,</hi> laden with Chains,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41263:79"/>into two ſeveral Priſons, reſolving to execute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he had done ſome other things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a more neceſſary ſpeed. In the mean time a Rumour being ſpread of more favourable Proceedings being intended toward them, leſt they ſhould eſcape their deſerved puniſhment, he took horſe in the night-time, poſts to <hi>Theana,</hi> where he put to death all that were in cuſtody there; thence haſting to <hi>Calena,</hi> he finiſh'd the work of his ſevere Reſolution: For though while yet the <hi>Campanians</hi> were bound to the ſtake, he had received Letters in favour of them, he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding kept the Letters as he received them in his left hand, commanding the Lictor to do his duty; nor would he open them, till he knew it was too late to obey them. By which Conſtancy of his he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the glory of a Victory: For if we make his Eſtimate by dividing the praiſe between himſelf, we ſhall finde him greater in <hi>Capua</hi> puniſh'd, than in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi> taken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was a Conſtancy in Severity; that which follows, a moſt admirable Conſtancy in piety, which <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> render'd indefatigable for the good of his Country. He told out the Money to <hi>Hannibal</hi> for the Captives; being publickly defrauded of it, he ſaid nothing. The Senate had made <hi>Minutius</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, equal to him in Authory, he held his tongue, And although provoked with many other injuries, he perſiſted in the ſame habit of minde; nor would ever give his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſion liberty to be angry with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, ſo ſtedfaſt was the love he bare to his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. In his managing the War, was not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy the ſame? The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire broken at the overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> ſeem'd ſcarce able to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Army; and therefore believing it to be better to delay and weary the force of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> than to come to Handy-blows with all his power,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41263:79"/>though provoked with the frequent taunts of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> though he had many times a fair opportunity of well ſucceeding offer'd, yet he would never recede from his own wholeſome deliberations, not ſo much as to the hazard of a Skirmiſh; and which is moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, he every where appear'd to be Superiour both to Anger and Hope. And therefore as <hi>Scipio</hi> by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſo he by not fighting reliev'd his Country: For the one ruin'd <hi>Carthage</hi> by his Celerity, the other by his delay took care that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the following Narration it will alſo appear, that <hi>Caius Piſo</hi> being Conſul at a time of much turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and combuſtion in the Commonwealth, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf with a wonderful Conſtancy. The fury of the people being highly moved by the deluſions of <hi>M. Palicanus,</hi> a ſeditious perſon, endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a moſt foul act at the great Aſſembly for chooſing Conſuls, intending to have given into his hands a moſt large Power, whoſe vile actions requir'd rather the utmoſt ſeverity of puniſhment, than any the leaſt mark of Honour. Nor was the furious flame of the Tribunes Authority wanting to incenſe the amazed Multitude. In this miſerable and ſhameful condition of the City, <hi>Piſo</hi> being plac'd before the Pulpit for Orations, though not by the hands of the Tribunes, and all flocking about him, and demanding of him whether he would declare <hi>Palicanus</hi> Conſul, now choſen by the Suffrages of the People, anſwered; Firſt, that he did not believe the Commonwealth had been overwhelm'd with ſo much darkneſs, as to act a thing ſo unworthy. And when the People ſtill preſs'd him to declare the Election, crying out, <hi>If it were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily done, let it be ſo,</hi> he replied, <hi>I will make no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi> With which ſhort Anſwer he bare away the Conſulſhip from <hi>Palicanus,</hi> before he had obtain'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41263:80"/>it. Thus <hi>Piſo</hi> contemn'd many terrible hazards, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainining to renounce the well-grounded rigour of his mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Metellus</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Numidian,</hi> for a perſeverance of the ſame nature, endured a ſtorm much unworthy his Majeſty and generous Manners. For when he perceived what <hi>Saturninus</hi> in his deſignes of miſchief aim'd at, and what ruin they would bring to the Commonwealth, if not timely prevented, he rather choſe Baniſhment, than to ſubmit to his Laws. Could there be any perſon thought more conſtant than this man? Who rather than he would act contrary to his judgment, ſuffer'd the want of his own Countrey, where he had attain'd to the higheſt degrees of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. However, though I prefer no one before him, yet may I not undeſervedly compare with him <hi>Scaevola</hi> the Soothſayer. <hi>Sylla</hi> having now quite defeated his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, and got the upper hand of his Enemies, and got poſſeſſion of the City, arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d as he was, compell'd the Senate to accompliſh his moſt eager deſire, that <hi>Marius</hi> might be by them declar'd an open Enemy. Whoſe Will when no one durſt withſtand, <hi>Scaevola</hi> alone being requir'd, refus'd to give his opinion in the Caſe. And when <hi>Sylla</hi> began with a frowning look to threaten him; <hi>Though,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou ſhouldſt ſhew me the bands of Shouldiers with which thou haſt ſurrounded the Senate, though thou threaten death never ſo often, thou ſhalt never make me yield, in hopes to keep warm my little and aged blood, to declare</hi> Marius <hi>an Enemy, by whom this City and all</hi> Italy <hi>has been preſerv'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. What has a Woman to do with publick Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? If the Cuſtome of our Countrey be obſerved, Nothing. But where Domeſtick Peace and Quiet is toſs'd upon the waves of Sedition, the Authority of Antient Cuſtome gives way. And that which Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41263:80"/>compels, more avails, than that which Modeſty perſwades and directs. And therefore, O <hi>Sempronia,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> Wife of <hi>Scipio Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus,</hi> I will not comprehend thee in a Narrative envious of thy worth, as abſurdly inſerting thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt weighty Examples of Vertue: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that being brought to anſwer before the People, by a Tribune of the Vulgar, thou haſt not degenerated from the greatneſs of thy Anceſtors in ſo vaſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, I will eternize thy Memory. Thou wert for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtand in that place, where the greateſt Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of the City were wont to be affronted. The higheſt in Authority powr'd out their Threats againſt thee with a ſevere and cruel Brow, backt with the Cries of the rude Multitude. The whole <hi>Forum</hi> eagerly endeavour'd that thou ſhouldſt acknowledge with a Kiſs <hi>Equitius,</hi> whom they unjuſtly labour to impoſe upon the <hi>Sempronian</hi> Stock, as the Son of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> thy Brother: yet didſt thou thruſt him from thee, a Monſter brought out of I know not what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of darkneſs, approaching with an execrable boldneſs, to uſurp a relation of Conſanguinity, where he had nothing of Alliance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The great Luminaries of our City will not take it amiſs, if in the number of their flaming Lights the virtue of the Centurions alſo make bold to ſhew it ſelf. For as humble Degree ought to reverence Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo antient Nobility ought rather to cheriſh than deſpiſe thoſe who are but newly advanc'd, by acts of Vertue. Wherefore then ought <hi>Pontius</hi> to be driven out of the Company of theſe Examples, who being upon an Out-guard in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, and ſurprized by a Party of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, when there was but one way left for him to ſave himſelf, if he would ſerve under <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> his Son in-law, fearleſs made this anſwer: Scipio,

In the firſt front whereof let <hi>Blaſſius</hi> appear, than whoſe Conſtancy there was nothing more ſtedfaſt. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to reſtore <hi>Salapia,</hi> where he was born, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, being then garriſon'd by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians;</hi> to this purpoſe, with more deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his Plot, than hope of obtaining his end, he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adventures to draw in <hi>Daſius,</hi> one that moſt fiercely diſagreed with him in the adminiſtration of Affairs, being wholly devoted to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but one without whoſe aſſiſtance he could not bring his deſigne about. This man preſently reports to <hi>Hannibal</hi> all that had paſs'd between him and <hi>Blaſſius,</hi> adding of his own what he thought would increaſe his own commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and render his enemy more odious. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41263:81"/>calls them both before him; the one to juſtifie, the other to defend what he ſtood accuſed of. Now it falling out ſo that the matter was brought before the Tribunal, while other matters of more moment were in diſpatch, <hi>Blaſſius</hi> with a fair face and low voice earneſtly admoniſh'd <hi>Daſius,</hi> to favour and aſſiſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> whereupon <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But not long after the wonderful Conſtancy of <hi>Blaſſius</hi> drew <hi>Daſius</hi> to his par y, by which means he delivered up <hi>Salapia</hi> to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with Five Hundred <hi>Numidians</hi> that were there in Garriſon.</p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41263:82"/>away with a moſt wicked and barbarous errour, had pronounced a moſt ſad ſentence againſt the ten Praetors, that had overthrown the Navy of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> at <hi>Aeginuſae.</hi> It hapned that <hi>Socrates</hi> was then in ſo great Authority, as at whoſe diſcretion the People made their publick Edicts; who thinking it an unworthy thing, that ſo many and ſo well deſerving perſons ſhould unworthily be taken off by the violence of Envy, oppos'd his own Conſtancy to the Raſhneſs of the Multitude: Nor could he be compell'd by the Clamours and violent Threats of the People, to give his conſent to their publick madneſs.

While he lay ill at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> in the extremity of his Sickneſs, the hopes of preſent Victory boyl'd in his Breaſt. And therefore calling his Phyſicians, he ſought for all Remedies to reſtore his health; who all pitching upon one Potion, which was to be made and given him by the hands of <hi>Philip</hi> his Friend and Companion, he received Letters at the ſame time from <hi>Parmenio,</hi> adviſing him to beware of the treachery of <hi>Philip,</hi> whom <hi>Darius</hi> had certainly corrupted. Nevertheleſs, after he had read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he drank off the Potion, and then gave the Letters to <hi>Philip</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which conſtant opinion of the Reality of his Friend, he received a moſt worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Immortal Gods, who would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Remedy of his Health to be diſappointed by any ſurmiſed Suſpition of Treachery in the delivery of it.</p>

                  <p>I Shall paſs to the moſt wholeſome part of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Moderation of Mind, which will not ſuffer our Minds to be diverted from the right way by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Raſhneſs. Whence it falls out to be not only without reprehenſion, but moſt wealthy in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41263:83"/>of praiſe; and therefore let us ſhew the effects thereof in men of Fame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And that I may begin from the Cradle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>P. Valerius,</hi> who for the honour he bore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the people, was called <hi>Poblicola;</hi> who after Kingſhip was driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing the whole ſtreſs of their power, the Enſignes of their Authority tranſlated to himſelf under the Title of Conſul, he reduced the envious height of Magiſtracy to a Habit eaſily to be endured. He made the <hi>Faſces</hi> give way to the <hi>Axes,</hi> in all publick Aſſemblies laying them down at the feet of the people: he brought the number of the <hi>Faſces</hi> to be leſs by one half, and of his own accord took <hi>Lucretius</hi> to be his Colleague in Authority; before whom, becauſe he was the Elder, he cauſed the <hi>Faſces</hi> to be carried firſt. He alſo enacted a Law in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Hundreds, That no Magiſtrate ſhould ſtrike or kill a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen; ſo that the freer the Condition of the City was, the more he by little and little extenuated his own Authority. He alſo pulled down his own houſe, becauſe that being ſeated in a higher part of the City, it ſeemed to have the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Caſtle. Thus lower in his houſe, did he not appear higher in his glory?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I can no ſooner forſake <hi>Poblicola,</hi> but I am pleas'd in coming to <hi>Furius Camillus:</hi> Whoſe Tranſlation and change from great Ignominies to higheſt Command, was ſo moderate, that when his Fellow-Citizens, after that <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> required his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being then an Exile in <hi>Ardea,</hi> he had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner began his Journey to <hi>Veii,</hi> there to take charge of the Army, but that he underſtood all things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in moſt ſolemn manner in relation to his being made Dictator. Magnificent was the <hi>Veientine</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of <hi>Camillus,</hi> famous was his Victory over the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but much more admirable that his Pauſe: for it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41263:84"/>was a harder labour for him to overcome himſelf than the Enemy; neither avoiding adverſity with too much haſte, nor meeting adverſity with too much joy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Equal to <hi>Furius</hi> in Moderation, was <hi>Marcius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius Cenſorinus:</hi> For being a ſecond time created Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, he called the people together to an Aſſembly, and in a Speech moſt ſharply reprehended them, that they had twice conferred that Office upon him; ſeeing that their Anceſtors thought rather fit to abridge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the time of holding the ſame, as being too great for one man. Both did well, both <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> and the people: for the one inſtructed them to beſtow their high Honour with Moderation, the other intruſted themſelves in the hands of a moderate perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Go to! <hi>L. Quinctius Cincinnatus,</hi> what a Conſul was he? whoſe honour when the Conſcript Fathers would have continued not onely for his egregious acts, but becauſe the people intended to continue the ſame Tribunes again the next year, neither of which could be legally done; he hindered the endeavours of both, not onely reſtraining the endeavours of the Senate, but conſtraining the Tribunes to follow the Example of his own Modeſty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> having obſerv'd that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been Conſul five times, and oftner by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Grandfather, and Great-Grandfather, at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the People, where his Son was created Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, pleaded very hard with the people, That they would permit a vacation of Honour to the Family of the <hi>Fabii:</hi> Not that he did miſtruſt the Vertues of his Son, for he was a perſon of great Honour, but that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Honour of the Commonwealth ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in one Family. What more powerful than this Moderation, that could ſo overcome his Fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are generally ſo ſtrong in Parents?</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:41263:84"/>
                  <p n="6">6. There was no Gratitude wanting among our Anceſtors to give the rewards due to the Elder <hi>African;</hi> ſeeing that they have endeavoured to adorn his greateſt Enterprizes with equal Honours. Willing they were to place his Statue in the great Halls of Juſtice, and Publick Aſſemblies, over the <hi>Roſtra</hi> in the Court; and in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, they were willing to adorn his Statue with Triumphal Habits, and lay it upon the Cuſhions or Beds of the Gods in the Capitol. They would have given him the Conſulſhip as long as he lived, or a perpetual Dictatorſhip. But he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during any Act of the People, nor Edict of the Senate to paſs in his behalf, carried himſelf with more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in refuſing thoſe Honours, than he had got in obtaining them.</p>
                  <p>With the ſame ſtrength of mind he defended the Cauſe of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Senate, when his own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by their Ambaſſadors accuſed him of raiſing Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among um. Adding, that it did not become the Conſcript Fathers to meddle in the affairs of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;</hi> with a moſt high moderation conſulting the ſafety of the one, and the dignity of the other; which amounted to a Victory, while both ſeemed to act the parts of an Enemy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> who was the firſt that taught that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could be vanquiſhed, and <hi>Syracuſe</hi> taken, when in the time of his Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> came into the City to complain againſt him, he would not permit the Senate to hear the Cauſe, becauſe his Colleague was by chance abſent, leſt the <hi>Sicilians</hi> ſhould grow fearful or remiſs in their Accuſation: But aſſoon as his Partner retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he himſelf was the firſt that put the Senate in mind of calling in the <hi>Syracuſans;</hi> and patiently heard them while they made their Complaints. And though they were commanded by <hi>Levinus</hi> to depart, yet he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41263:85"/>cauſed them to ſtay, that they might be preſent at his defence. Afterwards when both parties had been heard, he followed them going out of the Court, that the Senate might be the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ree in paſſing their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And when their Accuſations were rejected, he courteouſly embraced them, ſuppliantly entreating him to receive them into his protection. Moreover, having drawn <hi>Sicily</hi> by Lot, he yielded that Province to his Colleague. And indeed ſo often may the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Marcellus</hi> be varied, as he made uſe of various degrees of Moderation toward his Aſſocates.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How admirable did <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> render himſelf! For being Tribune of the People, though he bare a profeſs'd hatred to the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s both <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Aſiatic;</hi> yet when the <hi>Aſiatic Scipio</hi> not being able to pay the Money wherein he was condemn'd, was therefore by the Conſul commanded to be carried to Priſon, upon his appeal to the Colledge of Tribunes, when no man would intercede for him, he diſſenting and departing from the Colledge, made a Decree: And when every one thought that in the writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he would have us'd the words and expreſſions of an angry enemy; In the firſt place he ſwore that he was not friends with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and then recited this Decree of his own framing: <hi>That whereas</hi> Cornelius Scipio <hi>had caſt into Priſon the Captains of the Enemy, led before his Chariot on the day of his Triumph; it was unworthy and unbecoming the Majeſty of the</hi> Roman <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that be ſhould be led thither himſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not ſuffer it to be done.</hi> Then willingly the <hi>Roman</hi> People ſaw how <hi>Gracchus</hi> had deceived them in their opinion, and extoll'd his Moderation with deſerved Praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> is alſo to be number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d among the choice Examples of principal <hi>Moderation.</hi> He was partner in glory with <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> in the defeat
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41263:85"/>of <hi>Aſdrubal.</hi> Yet he choſe rather to follow him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing on Horſeback, than to accept of that honour of Triumph, which the Senate had equally decreed to him; becauſe the action was perform'd in <hi>Salinator</hi>'s Province. Wherefore he triumph'd without a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, ſo much the more renownedly, becauſe only the Victory of the one, but the Moderation of the other was thereby commended.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Nor does the Younger <hi>Africanus</hi> ſuffer us to paſs him by in ſilence: Who being Cenſor, when he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd the Army, and in the Sacrifice then wont to be made, the Scribe was alſo ſinging a ſolemn Hymn of Praiſe ſet down in the Books, the Gods were ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to proſper and advance the affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> People: <hi>They are,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in a condition good and great enough, and therefore I deſire the Gods to preſerve them ſafe as they are.</hi> And therefore ordered the Song to be mended accordingly in the publick Records. Which Modeſty the Cenſors when they muſter'd ever after us'd in their Prayers. Prudently believing, that then the increaſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was to be ſought, when they ſought for Triumphs but Seven Miles from the City. But when they now poſſeſſed the greateſt part of the World, that it was a piece of over-Covetouſneſs to deſire more. Being happy if they loſt nothing of what they had already won.</p>
                  <p>Nor did his Moderation appear leſs in his Cenſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before the Tribunal. For when he was muſtering the Centuries of the Horſemen, when he ſaw <hi>Licinius</hi> the Prieſt appear according to his Summons; <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that he hath perjur'd himſelf in a ſet form of fram'd words for the nonce.</hi> And therefore if any one would accuſe him, he would be a witneſs: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:41263:86"/>
                  <p n="11">11. Which temper of minde is alſo taken notice of in <hi>Q. Scaevola,</hi> a moſt excellent Perſonage: For being produced as a witneſs againſt a Criminal, when he had anſwered that which ſeemed to make much againſt the party, he added at his going away, that they ought not to give him onely Credit, unleſs many others did aver the ſame thing; for that to believe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of one, ſeem'd to be of a very evil Example: Whereby he procured that Faith which was due to his Sincerity, and at the ſame time gave wholſome advice for the Common good.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. I am ſenſible what Citizens, what Deeds and Sayings of theirs I am forced to comprehend in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs of Oration; but when many and great things are to be ſpoken concerning the renown of great men, there is no relation comprehending infinite perſons and tranſactions that can perform both. And therefore our purpoſe is not to praiſe, but to record them all; and therefore the two <hi>Metelli,</hi> the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Numidian,</hi> two the greateſt Ornaments of their Country, deſire leave to be briefly remember'd. The <hi>Macedonian Metellus</hi> had moſt eagerly contended with the <hi>African Scipio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and this Contention ariſing out of an Emulation of each others Vertue, grew to moſt grievous and terrible hatred of each other: but when he heard it reported that <hi>Scipio</hi> was ſlain, he ran into the publick ſtreet with a ſad Countenance and confuſed Out-cry, crying out, <hi>Arm, arm, Citizens arm, the Walls of our City are defaced and ruined:</hi> For <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> was, violently ſlain at home in his own houſe. Oh unhappy Commonwealth in the death of <hi>Africanus,</hi> but happy in the generous and kinde Lamentation of <hi>Macedonicus!</hi> For at the ſame time he made known how brave a Prince ſhe had loſt, and how brave a one ſhe enjoy'd. He ordered his Sons alſo to be the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of his Bier, adding this voice of Honour to his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41263:86"/>Funeral, <hi>That it would never be their fortune to perform that Office to a greater man.</hi> Where were now thoſe many Quarrels in the Court? thoſe many diſſentions before the Pulpits for Orations? where the Gown-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts of ſo great Leaders and Commonwealths-men? All theſe this moſt Venerable Moderation utterly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But the <hi>Numidian Metellus</hi> driven from his Country by Popular Faction, retir'd into <hi>Aſia;</hi> where when he received Letters as he was at <hi>Tralles</hi> beholding certain ſports, reporting that with the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Senate and People, his return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was freely granted him, he would not ſtir out of the Theatre till the Play was ended: Not ſhewing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny change of gladneſs to thoſe that ſate next him of any ſide, but confin'd his great joy within himſelf, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Countenance in his Exilement, as at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration. So indifferently did he behave himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Adverſity and Proſperity, by the advantage of his Moderation.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So many Families being numbered up famous for one kind of Vertue, is it fit that we leave out the <hi>Portian</hi> Name, as wanting their ſhare in this part of Glory? The younger <hi>Cato</hi> will not ſo permit it, not a little truſting to no ſmall Exemplar of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. He had brought the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Money with great diligence and ſincerity into the City; for which Office the Senate ordained, that at the next <hi>Praetorian</hi> Aſſemblies Extraordinary conſideration ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but he would not ſuffer it to be done, affirming it to be unjuſt, that what was never decreed to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be decreed to him. And leſt any new Cuſtome ſhould ariſe from his perſon, he rather choſe the hazards of the field, than to accept the kindneſs of the Senate.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. While I am endeavouring from hence to paſs to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41263:87"/>Forraign Examples, <hi>Marcus Bibulus,</hi> a perſon of great Dignity, and ſacred for his high Honours, lays hands upon me; who when he lay in <hi>Syria,</hi> receiving News that two of his Sons, of admirable hopes, were both ſlain by the Souldiers of <hi>Gabinius,</hi> the Murtherers of whom were afterwards ſent him bound by <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to take the revenge of ſo great a Calamity at his own pleaſure. He, notwithſtanding ſo great an advantage was offered him, that a perſon ſo provoked could not deſire a greater, yet cauſed his Grief to give way to his Moderation, ſending immediately back to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Butchers of his own fleſh and blood; telling her withal, That the power of Revenge did not belong to him, but to the Senate.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Architas</hi> the <hi>Tarentine,</hi> while he almoſt drowns himſelf at <hi>Metapontus</hi> in the Precepts of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> after long labour and ſtudy, having freighted himſelf with the whole Body of Learning, returned into his own Country; where when he came to look after his Eſtate, he found, through the negligence of his Bayliff, his Farms very much decay'd and ſpoil'd: Whereupon beholding his ill-deſerving Servant, <hi>I had moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>puniſh'd thee according to thy deſert, but that I am angry with thee.</hi> And therefore he had rather let him go unpuniſh'd, than in his anger puniſh him more than was juſt.</p>

For being over-vehemently provok'd by a Servant that had committed a great Crime, fearing he ſhould himſelf exceed the meaſure of his chaſtiſement, committed the correction to his Friend <hi>Speuſippus;</hi> deeming it an unhandſome thing if he had done amiſs, that the fault of his Servant, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41263:87"/>the correction of <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould deſerve the ſame repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: which makes me no leſs wonder that he was ſo conſtantly moderate toward <hi>Zenocrates</hi> his Scholar. <hi>Plato</hi> was informed that he had ſpoken ill of him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. He without heſitation ſlighted the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Informer very ſeriouſly asked him, Why he did not believe him? who replied, That it was not credible that he whom he loved ſo well ſhould not love him as well again. At length when the envie of the Make-bate confirm'd his ſtory with Oaths, he affirm'd, That he did not believe him perjur'd; however, if <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> did ſay ſuch things of him, he would not have ſaid them, but that he thought it convenient to ſpeak ſo. One would have thought his Soul had not kept her Station in a Mortal Body, but in a Celeſtial Tower, and as it were armed, that could ſo invincibly keep off the Incurſions of Humane Vices, keeping the whole number of Vertues in the cloſe Fortreſs of the breaſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Dion</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> could not deſerve equal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation with <hi>Plato</hi> for Learning, but of his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he gave a larger Experiment. He being expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Country by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, went to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara;</hi> where coming to give the King of that City a Viſit, but not finding admittance after a long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious waiting, ſaid he to his friend, <hi>This is patiently to be endured, for perhaps when we were in Authority we our ſelves did ſomething like this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> By wtveh tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Minde he made his own Exile more pleaſing to himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Thraſibulus</hi> is next to be recorded: who when the people of <hi>Athens</hi> were forced to leave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try through the Cruelty of the Thirty Tyrants, and to live miſerably diſperſed, and wandering without any home, brought them back to their own Country. However, he made the victorious Reſtoration of their Liberty more renowned by his moſt applauded Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41263:88"/>For he made a Law, That no mention ſhould be made of things paſt. This Act of Oblivion which the <hi>Athenians</hi> call <hi>Amneſtia,</hi> reſtored the ſhaken and decaying State of the City to its former condition of Honour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Not leſs admirable is this that follows. <hi>Staſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> of <hi>Tegea,</hi> when his friends adviſed him by any means to kill or remove a perſon that was his Rival in the Adminiſtration of the Commonwealth, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a very juſt and upright perſon, denied to do any ſuch act, ſcaring that the place in Government, which a good man now enjoyed, ſhould be poſſeſſed by one of a perverſe and evil diſpoſition, coming in his room.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The breaſt of <hi>Pittacus</hi> was well endued with Moderation; who being become an abſolute Tyrant over his Country, when <hi>Alcaeus</hi> the Poet not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him with an inveterate hatred, but with the ſtrength of his ſharp Wit, onely gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what was in his power to do.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The mention which I have made of this man, brings to our conſideration the Moderation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Wiſe men. A certain perſon had bought a Draught of certain Fiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By reaſon of the novelty of the Accident, and the value of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the buſineſs was referred to the judgment of all the City: they thought it convenient to conſult the Oracle to whom the Table belonged: the God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was to be given to him that excelled in Wiſdom, in theſe words:</p>

                  <p>WHich being demonſtrated by many and moſt renowned preſidents, let us paſs to a moſt rare Affection of the Mind, or the courſe of Hatred to Friendſhip, and let us purſue it in a pleaſant Style. For it the boiſterous Sea prove calm, and the ſtormy Sky appear with a ſerene aſpect, and War making a change for Peace, be no ſmall cauſe of comfort; the aſſwagement of the bitterneſs of Hatred is to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with a candid Narration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> twice Conſul, and high Prieſt, equal in the Splendour of his Honours to the Gravity of his Life, bare an inveterate and continued Hatred to <hi>Fulvius Flaceus,</hi> a perſon of the ſame digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which aſſoon as they were both declared Cenſors together, he laid aſide in the Field. Believing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable for thoſe to be at private difference, who were coupled together in Supreme publick Authority.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41263:89"/>That judgment of his mind the preſent Age hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the old Writers of Annals have recorded to us as a thing moſt worthy of applauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor would they let the illuſtrious advice of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Salinator</hi> for the ending of Quarrels be unknown to Poſterity. For though he went into Exile with a burning hatred againſt <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> anger'd at the teſtimony which he gave againſt him; yet when the People had recall'd him, and made him Partner with <hi>Nero</hi> in the Conſulſhip, he commanded himſelf to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own diſpoſition, which was moſt fiery, and the heavy injury which he had received. Leſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to take the Conſorſhip of Government, through the inward diſaffection of his mind, he ſhould have acted the part of an evil Conſul, by ſhewing his hatred to his Enemy. Which inclination of his mind to a better diſpoſition, in an unſafe and difficult conjuncture of affairs, wrought no ſmall advantage to the City and all <hi>Italy;</hi> while they ſupported with an equal ſtrength of vertue, were the firſt that broke the force and turn'd the fortune of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A fair Example alſo we finde in the Elder <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> and <hi>T. Gracchus</hi> of Enmity laid aſide. For at the ſacred Rites of that Table, to which they came with a boyling Hatred each to other, from the ſame Table they departed entire Friends. For <hi>Scipio,</hi> at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Senate, not contented to enter into Friendſhip with <hi>Gracchus</hi> in the Capitol, at the Feaſt of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> he there alſo eſpouſed his Daughter <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This gentile humour appear'd chiefly in <hi>M. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero:</hi> For he moſt vehemently defended <hi>A. Gabinius</hi> accus'd of Bribery, who had expell'd him out of the City in his Conſuſhip. And the ſame perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd <hi>P. Vatinius</hi> from two publick Judgements, though he were alwaies an enemy to his Dignity: As
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41263:90"/>without any imputation of Levity, ſo with ſome Praiſe. For with better pretence Injuries are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Benefits, than retaliated with obſtinate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Which act of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ſeem'd ſo laudable, that <hi>P. Pulcher,</hi> his utter Enemy, did not diſdain to follow it. Who being accus'd of Inceſt by the three <hi>Lentuli,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived one of them into his protection, at the ſame time accuſed for corrupting the People, to obtain an Office: and gave his mind wholly (beholding the Judge, the Praetor, and the Temple of <hi>Veſta</hi>) to act all Friendſhip for the ſame <hi>Lentulus,</hi> though the other at the ſame time endeavoured to ruine his reputation with a ſoul crime.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Caninius Gallus</hi> alſo ſhew'd himſelf wonderful in Courteſie both toward the Criminal, and to his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: For to <hi>Antonius,</hi> whom he had condemn'd, he gave his Daughter; and <hi>Colonius,</hi> by whom he was accuſed, he made Overſeer of his Eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As for <hi>Caelius Rufus,</hi> though his Life were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, yet the Pity that he ſhewed to <hi>Q. Pompeius</hi> was to be applauded; who being caſt at a publick Trial by himſelf, when his Mother <hi>Cornelia</hi> would not reſtore the Farms, which he had conveyed to her in truſt, at the requeſt of <hi>Lentulus</hi> in a Letter, he with great fervency made a Journey to her: He ſhewed the Letter, which teſtified the Neceſſity of <hi>Pompey;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he overcame the impious Covetouſneſs of <hi>Cornelia.</hi> A deed, for its moſt compaſſionate Humanity, to be applauded even in <hi>Caelius</hi> himſelf; and to be imitated, though <hi>Rufus</hi> were the Author.</p>

For that City, that Family, that Kingdom eaſily remains in a laſting and firm degree of Eſtabliſhment, where Luſt and Avarice challenge the leaſt prerogative. For where thoſe Plagues of Humane kinde have gotten ſooting, there Injury prevails, and Infamy rages. But forgetting thoſe, let us call to minde Cuſtomes contrary to thoſe moſt peſtilent Vices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Scipio</hi> in the twenty fourth year of his Age, having taken <hi>New Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and conceiving
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41263:91"/>in his mind proſperous hopes of taking the greater <hi>Carthage,</hi> had regained into his power many Hoſtages, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> kept cloſe in that Town, and among the reſt a Virgin of moſt ſurpaſſing Beauty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in years, though he were young, unmarried and a Conquerour, yet underſtanding that ſhe was of a Noble Family among the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and affianced to <hi>Indibilis,</hi> one of the Princes of that Countrey, he ſent for her Parents and her Spouſe, and delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd to her own Friends, adding to her Dowry the Gold that was brought for her Ranſome. Which Continency and Bounty of his ſo moved <hi>Indibilis,</hi> that he wrought with the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> to take part with the <hi>Romans,</hi> thereby approving himſelf truly grateful for ſo great a favour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Spain</hi> was a witneſs of this mans Abſtinence, ſo did <hi>Epirus, Achaia,</hi> the <hi>Cyclade</hi> Iſlands, the Sea-Coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> give teſtimony to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of <hi>Cato:</hi> From whence when he had the charge of ſending great ſums of Money, he carried himſelf as free from Wantonneſs, as from deſire of Gain, though he had opportunity enough to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate in both: For the Royal Treaſure was all at his charge, and he was forced every where to take up his Lodgings in Cities the moſt fruitful of all pleaſures. And this is teſtified in writing by <hi>Minatius Rufus,</hi> his faithful Companion in the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Expedition. Though I rely not altogether upon his teſtimony; the ſubject it ſelf is a ſufficient proof, ſeeing that <hi>Cato</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence were both born from the ſame Womb of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moſt certain it is that <hi>Druſus Germanicus,</hi> the glory of the <hi>Claudian</hi> Family, a rare Ornament of his Countrey, and which is above all the reſt, for the greatneſs of his Actions, conſidering his Age, near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Grandeur of his Imperial Father-in-Law
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41263:91"/>and Brother, was eminently known to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd his love of Women within the particular and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle affection to his own Wife. <hi>Antonia</hi> alſo, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſurpaſſing in Praiſe the Maſculine Renown of her Family, recompenſed the love of her Husband with a Fidelity anſwerable: And after his deceaſe, in the Flower of his Age and Beauty, eſpouſed her ſelf to the Houſe of her Mother-in-law; ſo that in the ſame bed the Vigorous Youth of the one extinguiſhed, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Widowhood of the other grew aged. And ſo let this Chamber put an end to theſe Examples.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us now ſpend ſome time upon Examples of thoſe who never car'd for money. <hi>Caius Marcius</hi> a young Gentleman of the <hi>Porcian</hi> Family, deſcended from the Renowned Progeny of King <hi>Ancus;</hi> who had their ſirname from <hi>Coriolum</hi> a Town of the <hi>Volſci</hi> by them taken: when for his noble acts of Fortitude, he was praiſed at the head of the Army by <hi>Poſthumius Cominius</hi> the Conſul, and reward given him of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gifts, beſides a hundred Acres of Land, his choice of ten Captives, as many Horſes with their Trappings, a Herd of a hundred Oxen, and a great weight of Silver; yet he refuſed all, accepting of nothing but the liberty of one Captive that was his Hoſt, and one Horſe for ſervice: Through which circumſpect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of minde, it is hard to judge whether he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited moſt in deſerving of refuſing thoſe Rewards.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>M. Curius,</hi> a moſt exact Rule of <hi>Roman</hi> Frugality, as well as a perfect Preſident of Fortitude, was not aſham'd to ſhew himſelf ſitting upon a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-form before the fire at Supper in a Wooden platter. (You may gueſs at his Dainties.) He contemn'd the Riches ot the <hi>Samnites,</hi> the <hi>Samnites</hi> admir'd his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: For when they brought him a great weight of Gold, ſent him by their Country-men for a Preſent, and kindly deſired him to accept of it, he fell into a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41263:92"/>laughter, and preſently, quoth he, <hi>You that are come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a needleſs, if I may not all it idle Embaſſie, go tell the</hi> Samnites, <hi>That</hi> Curius <hi>had rather command rich men than be rick himſelf; and carry back that pretious gift invented to the evil of mankind; and remember that I can neither be overcome in Battle, nor be corrupted with Money.</hi> The ſame perſon when he had driven <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> nevertheleſs would nor touch the leaſt part of all thoſe Royal ſpoils that did ſo inrich the City. Moreover, he would not exceed the uſual meaſure of Popular aſſignement, though the Senate gave to himſelf Fifty Acres of Land, to the people but Seven Acres; eſteeming him no good Citizen, that could not be contented with what was given to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of the ſame opinion was <hi>Fabricius Luſcinus,</hi> greater than any perſon of his time in Honour and Authority; in Eſtate not above the meaneſt: Who when the <hi>Samnites,</hi> who were under his protection, ſent him a Preſent of Ten pound of coyned Silver, Five pound weight of Gold, and as many Servants, he ſent them back to <hi>Samnium;</hi> by the advantage or his Continency rich without Money, and attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Family; ſo much did he abound in Honour pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the contempt of thoſe things. Nor was the expectation of <hi>Fabricius</hi> unanſwered in the refuſal of thoſe Preſents: For the Embaſſadour returning ſo <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> and hearing <hi>Cyrnas</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> telling the King of a certain <hi>Athenian</hi> famous for his Wiſdom, who was of opinion that men ſhould do nothing but for pleaſure's ſake, look'd upon it as a monſtrous ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and immediately decri'd that kind of Wiſdom, both before <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and the <hi>Samnites.</hi> For though the <hi>Athenians</hi> did glory in their Learning, yet there was no prudent perſon but would rather chuſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſelf-den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>Fabricius,</hi> than the Precepts of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41263:92"/>
                     <hi>Epicurus:</hi> which the event prov'd true: For that City which indulged ſo much pleaſure, loſt a very large Dominion; but an induſtrious and laborious Country holds its own: And this City could beſtow that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which the other valu'd not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 One might eaſily conjecture <hi>Elius Tubero,</hi> ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Carus,</hi> to have been the Diſciple of <hi>Curius</hi> and <hi>Fabricius,</hi> to whom, being then Conſul, when the <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> ſent a vaſt preſent of Silver Plate, not onely of a very great weight, but alſo moſt exquiſitely wrought; by reaſon that their Embaſſadours whom they had formerly ſent to congratulate him, upon their return had related how they ſaw him feeding onely in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Diſhes: He immediately bid them be gone with their Baggage, admoniſhing them withal, that they ſhould not think that Continency and Poverty wanted the ſame ſupply. How well did he prefer his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick meanneſs before the <hi>Etolian</hi> Splendour, if the ſucceeding Ages would have followed his Example! But now to what a height are we grown, that Servants refuſe to make uſe of that Houſhold-ſtuff, which would ſerve a Conſul before?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But after the overthrow of <hi>Perſeus, Paulus</hi> had ſo glutted the old Hereditary poverty of our City with Wealth, that at that time the <hi>Roman</hi> people firſt began to think of laying Taxes; yet no way enriched his own Family, accompting it enough that he by his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories got Honour, while others got the money.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this ſound judgment of his, <hi>Q. Fabius Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Cn. Fabius Pictores,</hi> and <hi>Ogulnius,</hi> ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, who being ſent Embaſſadours to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> ſent thoſe Gifts which they had privately receiv'd from the King, into the publick Treaſury, before they would give an account of their Embaſſie to the Senate; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was nothing due for faithful ſervice to the publick, but the reward of Praiſe. But now the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41263:93"/>Senate ſhew'd their gratitude, and the exact diſcipline of our Anceſtors. For what they had laid up in the Treaſury was reſtor'd to the Embaſſadours not only by the Decree of the Senate, but by the conſent of the People, which was by the Queſtors with the ſame willingneſs paid. Thus the Liberality of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Abſtinence of the Embaſſadours, the Equity of the Senate and People, had in all an equal ſhare of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That <hi>Calpurnius Piſo</hi> was an Imitator of the <hi>Fabii</hi> and <hi>Ogulnii,</hi> the Story makes manifeſt. The Conſul having freed <hi>Sicily</hi> from the bloody War of the Fugitives, like a Commander rewarded thoſe with Gifts, whoſe aſſiſtance he had made moſt uſe of; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt he gave to his Son, who had behaved himſelf valiantly, a Crown of Three Pound weight of Gold, ſaying withal, <hi>That the chief Magiſtrate ſhould not take out of the publick Treaſure to expend upon his own Family; and that therefore he would leave ſo much Gold over and above to the Young man in his Will, to pay for it; that though he received his Honour publickly, he ſhould receive the price privately from his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Let us ſee if we can finde any great perſon in this age that makes uſe of Goatskins for his Coverlid, and while he rules all <hi>Spain,</hi> has but three Servants to attend him; that ſpent no more than Five Hundred Farthings and ſomewhat over in his preparation for his Journey; that drank the ſame Drink, and eat the ſame Meat which the Mariners fed upon; would not that be wonderful indeed? Yet all this did the Elder <hi>Cato</hi> patiently endure, confining himſelf with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, delight to a pleaſing cuſtome of Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Younger <hi>Cato</hi> was born at a great diſtance from the Continence of the antient times, coming into the world at ſuch a time, when the City abounded in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41263:93"/>Riches and all manner of Voluptuouſneſs. Yet he having a command in the Civil Wars, and having his Son along with him, nevertheleſs had but twelve Servants with him; in number more than the former <hi>Cato</hi> uſed, but the alteration of the times being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, fewer.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I am not a little delighted in repeating the Acts of Illuſtrious Heroes. <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> after he had born two Conſulſhips, and been eminent for two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of his own Conqueſts, yet went upon a great Embaſſie accompanied with no more than Seven At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. And yet 'tis believed he might have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd more with the Spoils of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> but that the praiſe of his great deeds ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to himſelf, the Spoils to his Countrey. And therefore when he travell'd through the Countries of his Aſſociates and Allies, and other forraign Nations, they were not accompted his Slaves, but his Victories. Nor did men conſider how much Gold and Silver, but how much weight of worth he bare about him.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This Continence appear'd in the very breaſts of the generality of the People, but it ſhall ſuffice to relate two Examples of ages far diſtant one from another. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> when he ſaw the violence of his fury at a ſtand, &amp; that the hearts of his <hi>Epirotes</hi> began to fail, designing to purchaſe the good will of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, whoſe Vertue he could not overecome, had tranſported almoſt all the wealth of his Treaſures into our City. But when his Embaſſadours went from Houſe to Houſe with great Gifts fit for the uſe of Men and Women, they could not finde a door open to them. Thus the more ſtout than proſperous defender of the <hi>Tarentine</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, was repulſed and defeated as well by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes as Arms of the City; nor can I determine which was the greateſt Victory. In that ſtorm alſo with which <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> infeſted the Common-wealth,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41263:94"/>wonderful was the abſtinence of the People. For when they leſt the people at liberty to ranſack the houſes of them that were by themſelves proſcribed, there was no man to be found that would lay hands upon the Prey of civil Diſcord. For every one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained from uſing violence toward them, as from things conſecrated to the Gods: Which compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate abſtinence of the common people, was a tacit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Cruelty of the Victors.</p>

And leſt we ſhould be thought to envy the ſame applauſe to ſtrangers, <hi>Pericles</hi> Prince of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> having for his Companion in the Pretorſhip <hi>Sophocles</hi> the <hi>Tragoedian,</hi> whom he obſerv'd at the ſame time to utter certain Expreſſions over-laviſh in the praiſe of a beautiful Boy that paſs'd by, reprehended him in theſe words: <hi>That a Magiſtrate ought to keep his eyes front luſtful deſires, as well as his hands from unlawful gain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf being now ſtricken in years, and being demanded by one whether he yet minded his Youthful dalliances, <hi>The Gods have taught me better,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for I fled from it of my own accord, as from a furius Contagion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of equal Continency was <hi>Xenocrates</hi> in his old Age; of whoſe opinion the following Relation is no ſmall teſtimony. <hi>Phryne,</hi> a noble Curteſan of <hi>Athens,</hi> while he was in drink, laid herſelf upon the bed by him, having receiv'd a ſum of money to try if ſhe could tempt him. But though he neither refuſed to hear her flattering allurements, nor to let her ſtroak and handle him, but let her lie dallying in his boſome, yet he at length put her off without prevailing in her deſigne. An abſtemious act of a mind endu'd with wiſdom. But the ſaying of the Curteſan was very facetious: For the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41263:94"/>young men deriding her that ſhe being ſo handſome and witty, could not win the affection of an old man; and refuſing to give het what they had engaged, ſhe made anſwer, <hi>The Bargain was to deal with a Man, and not a Statue.</hi> Could this Continence of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> be more truly demonſtrated, more truly or properly by any one than by the expreſſion of the Curteſan her ſelf? For <hi>Phryne</hi> with all her Beauty could not weaken nor move the moſt conſtant Abſtinence of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What think ye of King <hi>Alexander?</hi> could he tempt him with his Riches? You would have thought him a Statue, though equally aſſail'd as well by the King as by the Curteſan. The King ſent Embaſſadours to him with a Preſent of ſome Talents, whom being brought into the Academy, was entertain'd according to his cuſtom, after his mean and poor faſhion. The next day the Embaſſadours asking him if he would have his Money told out, <hi>I had thought,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by your ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdays entertainment, that you had underſtood that my condition does not require Money.</hi> Thus while the King was deſirous to buy the friendſhip of the Philoſopher, the Philoſopher denies to ſell it him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſame <hi>Alexander</hi> having obtained the name of Invincible, could not conquer the Continence of <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynie;</hi> to whom, as he was fitting in the Sun, when he came and bid him tell him wherein he might do him a kindneſs, as he lay in the ſhade, of a ſordid converſation, but of a flout minde, quoth he, <hi>As to the reſt of thy preſſers, by and by; but in the mean time, do not ſtand between me and the Sun.</hi> Which words carried a deep ſenſe with them: ſo <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> might ſooner overcome <hi>Darius</hi> with his Arms, than remove <hi>Diogenes</hi> from his low eſtate to love wealth.

                  <p>THat Children are the greateſt Ornaments to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we finde written by <hi>Pomponius Rufus</hi> in his Book of Collections, in theſe words. When a <hi>Campanian</hi> Lady lying at the Houſe or <hi>Cornelia,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> ſhewed her her Jewels and other Ornaments, which were the faireſt of any in that time, <hi>Cornelia</hi> held her in diſcourſe till her Children return'd from School. <hi>And theſe,</hi> quoth ſhe, when they appeared, <hi>are my Ornaments.</hi> For he hath all things that covets nothing, and much more certainly than he that poſſeſſes all things. For great Eſtates many times fail, but a good Habit of Minde is above the violence of Fortune. And therefore what matters it, whether we put Riches in the higheſt part of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or Poverty in the loweſt degree of Miſery? Eſpecially when the chearful countenance of Wealth is full of many conceal'd Bitterneſſes; and the more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41263:95"/>rugged and deformed aſpect of Poverty many times abounds with many ſure and ſolid Contents.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The pride of <hi>Tarquin</hi> having put an end to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government, <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> with <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> his Colleague auſpiciouſly began the Office of Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The ſame perſon having afterwards born three Conſulſhips to the great content of the People, and by many and moſt renowned Actions having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the Grandeur of his Nobility: And yet this great Pillar of Hiſtory died, not leaving a Patrimony ſufficient for the expences of his Funeral, which were therefore defray'd at the Publick charge. It imports not to make any farther ſearch into the Poverty of ſo great a Perſon, for it is apparent what he poſſeſſed when he lived, though being dead he wanted both a Bier and Funeral-Pile.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may well gueſs how high in Dignity <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Menenius</hi> was, whom the Senate and People choſe Arbitrator of their differences, and to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween um. For how great ought he to be, who was Umpire of the publick Safety? This man, unleſs the People had gathered among themſelves the ſixth part of a Penny to make up the Sum, could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed his meer Funeral-Expences, dying ſo poor that he wanted for the decency of Burial; and therefore the City divided by pernicious Sedition, were content to be reconcile by the Ghoſts of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who though they were poor, yet they had obſerved them to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly ſincere. Who as he had nothing while he lived that could be publikly taxed, yet being deceas'd had the Concord and Unity of the City for his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I cannot deny but that there was Silver in the Houſes of <hi>Caius Fabricius</hi> and <hi>Q. Emilius Papus,</hi> the moſt principal men of their times. But <hi>Fabricius</hi> ſeem'd the more prodigal, becauſe he had a Horn-foot
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41263:96"/>to his Drinking-cup. But <hi>Papus</hi> ſeem'd more head-ſtrong, who having received his Goods as hereditary, would not alienate them for religions ſake.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They were alſo certainly very rich who were call'd from the Plough to be made Conſuls s for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſake they plough'd the ſandy and barren Soil of <hi>Pupinia,</hi> and ignorant of delicacy ſcatter'd thoſe vaſt clods with c ntinued ſweat and labour; ſo that thoſe whom the dangers of the Common wealth call'd to be Emperours and Generals, their want at home (for why ſhould truth conceal a Sirname?) compell'd to follow the call of Cowherds.</p>

They who were ſent by the Senate to call <hi>Atilius</hi> to undertake the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, found him ſowing in his Garden; but thoſe hands, hardned with Countrey-labour, eſtablih'd the ſafety of the Common-wealth, and defeated mighty Armies of the Enemies; and thoſe hands that lately held the Plough, now hold the reins of the Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot: Nor was he aſham'd, when he had laid down his Ebony Staff, to return again to the Plough Tail. Well may <hi>Atilius</hi> comfort the Poor, but much more inſtruct the Rich, how little the troubleſome care of gathering Riches, advantages the true deſire of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing ſolid Honour.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of the ſame name and blood, <hi>Atilius Regulas,</hi> the greateſt glory and the greateſt calamity of the <hi>Punic</hi> War, when he had ruin'd the wealth of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent <hi>Carthaginian</hi> by the ſucceſs of many Victories, and underſtood that his authority was continued for the next year, upon conſideration of his worthy deeds; he wrote to the Conſuls, that his Bayly of his little Farm that he had in the Countrey of <hi>Popinia</hi> was dead, and that one that he had hired was gone away with his Utenſils of Agriculture, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that a Succeſſour might be ſent him, leſt his land
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41263:96"/>lying untill'd, his Wife and Children ſhould want Bread. Which when the Conſuls had related to the Senate, they caus'd his ground to be let, and ſetled a Livelihood upon his Wife and Children, and ordered thoſe things that he had loſt to be redeem'd. Such was the Example of <hi>Atilius</hi>'s vertue to our Treaſury, that every Age will boaſt of among the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Equally large were the Farms of <hi>L. Quinctius Cincinnatus:</hi> For he poſſeſſed only ſeven Acres of Land; and of theſe he had loſt three, forfeited for a Fine, being bound to the Treaſury; and with the reſt of this little Land he paid another Forfeiture for his Son <hi>Caeſo,</hi> for not appearing when he was call'd to anſwer the Law. And yet when he was ploughing only four Acres of this Land, he not only upheld the dignity of his Family, but had the Dictatorſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetr'd upon him. He accompts himſelf to live ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly now, whoſe Houſe ſtands upon as much ground as all <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> Farm contain'd.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Aelian</hi> Family? How rich were they? There were Sixteen of that name, whoſe little Cottage ſtood where now the <hi>Marian</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtand, and a ſmall Farm in the Countrey of the <hi>Veii,</hi> that needed fewer men to till it than it had Owners; and in the Pariſhes call'd <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia</hi> they had the ground where the Theater ſtood beſtowed upon them for their vertue by the Publick.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That Family had not one ſcruple of Silver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Paulus,</hi> after he had utterly defeated <hi>Perſes,</hi> gave to <hi>Aelius Tubero,</hi> his Son-in-Law, five Pound weight of Gold, out of the Spoils that were taken. I omit, that the chief perſon of the City gave his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage to one whoſe Family and Eſtate was ſo exceeding low. And he himſelf died ſo very poor, that unleſs he had ſold one Farm which he had left, there had not been ſufficient for the Dowry of his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41263:97"/>Wife. The minds of Men and Women were then moſt noble in the City, and the worth of every Man was then in all things weighed againſt his Goods and Eſtate. For every one made it his buſineſs to ſerve his Country, not himſelf: And they rather choſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in a rich Empire, than riches in a poor Empire. And to this noble reſolution that reward was given, that it was not lawful to buy any of thoſe things which were due to Vertue; and the wants of Illuſtrious Men were ſupply'd out of the publick Stock.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And therefore, when <hi>Cneus Scipio</hi> had written out of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Senate, deſiring that a ſucceſſor might be ſent him, for that he had a daughter now fit for marriage, and that no portion could be provided for her, without he were preſent: The Senate, leſt the Commonwealth ſhould looſe a good Captain, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the office of a Father, and having with the advice of his Wife and Relations agreed upon the Portion, cauſed it to be paid out of the publick Treaſury. The Portion was two thouſand pieces of braſs mony: whereby not only appears the kindneſs of the <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> but the uſual meaſure of the ancient Eſtates may be gueſſed at. For they were ſo ſmall, that <hi>Tatia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cato</hi> was ſaid to have brought her Husband an exceeding Portion, when ſhe brought him ten thouſand pieces of braſs mony. And <hi>Megullia,</hi> that entred her husbands houſe with fifty thouſand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of braſs mony, was called for that reaſon, the <hi>Maid with the Portion.</hi> And therefore the Senate vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the daughters of <hi>Fabricius Luſcinus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> from being portionleſs, by their own Liberality, ſeeing their Parents had nothing to give them but their wealthy honours.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. What inheritance <hi>M. Scaurus</hi> received from his Father, he himſelf relates in the firſt Book that he hath wrote concerning his Life. For, ſaith he, <hi>he had but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41263:97"/>ten Slaves, and the whole value ef his Eſtate, was but thirty five thouſand pieces of mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Examples therefore we ought to regard, and quiet our minds with the Conſolation thereof, who are always complaining of the ſcantineſs of our own Fortunes. We find no Silver, or a very ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, few Servants, ſeven Acres of barren Land, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Indigency, Funeral expences publickly defray'd, Daughters without Portions: But we behold famous Conſulſhips, wonderful Dictatorſhips, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Triumphs. Why do we therefore with continual reproaches torment a mean Fortune, as the chief evil of human kind? Who though with not ſuperfluouſly flowing, yet with faithful breaſts, nouriſhed the <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licolae,</hi> the <hi>Emilii,</hi> the <hi>Fabricii,</hi> the <hi>Curii,</hi> the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> the <hi>Scauri,</hi> and all thoſe other ſupports of Vertue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to theſe. Let us rather pull up our ſpirits, and comfort our minds, debilitated with the ſight of mony, with the memory of former times.</p>

                  <p>FRom whence it ſeems ſeaſaſonable to paſs away to Baſhfulneſs: for this inſtructed the moſt juſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41263:98"/>men to neglect their own private Eſtates, and to have regard only to the publick. A vertue worthy, that to her ſhould be Temples rear'd and conſecrated, as to a Celeſtial Numen; as being the Parent of all good Counſel, the Guardianeſs of the moſt ſolemn Offices, the Miſtreſs of Innocency; dear to her own, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Strangers, and in all places, and at all times, carrying a favourable Aſpect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But that we may return from the praiſes to the actions thereof, from the firſt building of the City, to the time that <hi>Africanus</hi> and <hi>T. Longus</hi> were Conſuls, the Senate and People ſate at the beholding all Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and ſhews promiſcuouſly together: yet not one of the people would venture to take place before any of the Senate. So circumſpect was the modeſty of our Citizens; a moſt certain experiment whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on that day, when <hi>T. Flaminius</hi> being by the Cenſor removed from the Senate, was contented to stand in the hindermoſt part of the Theater, though he had been Conſul, and was the brother of <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Vanquisher of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Which the people no ſooner beheld, but they compelled him to take that place which his Dignity required.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> gave a great wound to the Commonwealth, by his raſh giving battle at <hi>Cannae.</hi> Yet by his refuſing to take upon him the Dictatorſhip, which after that was decreed him by the full conſent of the Senate and People; by his baſhful modeſty, made ſatisfaction for the fault of a moſt fatal overthrow: and through his modeſt behaviour, made men impute the publick Calamity, not to him, but to the anger of the Gods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us behold a more famous piece of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Fortune, not without great envy, had brought <hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> the ſon of the elder <hi>Africanus,</hi> together with <hi>Cicereius</hi> the Scribe, into the Common Hall for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41263:98"/>Election of Pretors; and very much reprehended he was, that he had abuſed the Nobility and authority of ſo great a perſon, by appearing at ſuch an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But <hi>Cicereius</hi> turned his crime to his praiſe. For when he ſaw himſelf preferr'd by all the Centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Scipio,</hi> he went out of the Temple, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Candidates Garment, came in again and gave his voice for <hi>Scipio.</hi> Being more willing to yield the Pretorſhip to the memory of <hi>Africanus,</hi> than to Challenge it for himſelf. Nor was the reward of his Modeſty ſmall; for though <hi>Scipio</hi> obtained the Pretor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet <hi>Cicereius</hi> was more applauded.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And that we may not preſently leave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall, when <hi>L. Craſſus</hi> ſtood for the Conſulſhip, and was by all perſwaded after the manner of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates, to go round the <hi>Forum,</hi> and beg the voices of the people, he could by no perſwaſions be induced to do it, though <hi>Q.

                  <p n="6">6. Which as it often appear'd moſt eminent in <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar,</hi> ſo moſt remarkably at his death: For being aſſail'd with the points of many parracidical weapons, when his divine Soul was ſeparated from his mortal Body, could not be frighted, after he had received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty three wounds, from his obedience to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41263:99"/>For he let down the lower part of his Gown with both hands, that he might fall with the lower part of his Body covered. In this manner not men, but the Immortal Gods, recover their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>That which follows, I will aſcribe to Forraigners, as happening before any City was given to <hi>Hetruria.</hi> There was in that Country one <hi>Spurina,</hi> a young man of ſurpaſſing beauty; whoſe lovely aſpect, alluring the eyes of the moſt Illuſtrious Ladies, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing himſelf to be ſuſpected of unchaſtity by the Husbands and Parents of thoſe women; with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounds gaſh'd and ſpoyl'd the beauty of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; chooſing rather deformity for the Guardian of his fidelity, than that his beauty ſhould be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of others Luſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                  <p>FRom a gentle and mild Affection, I will proceed to another as equally honeſt, yet ſomewhat more fervent, and of a more vehement Nature; and offer not without greateſt Veneration, as it were certain Images of lawful love, to the Contemplation of the Reader, effectually relating the actions of eſtabliſhed and firm fidelity between married people, difficult to imitate, but profitable to be known: ſeeing that when a man knows the moſt excellent Examples, it will be a ſhame to him to follow the meaneſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Titus Gracchus</hi> having caught two ſnakes in his own houſe, a Male and Female; and being told by the Soothſayer, that if he let go the Male, it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the death of his Wife; if he let go the Female, his own ſuddain deceaſe; following that part of the prediction that portended his own, rather than the death of his Wife, he cauſed the Female Snake to be let go; and was ſo hardy as to behold his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the death of the Snake kill'd before his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41263:100"/>face. And therefore I cannot determine whether <hi>Cornelia</hi> were more happy that ſhe had ſuch a Husband, or more miſerable in his loſs. O <hi>Admetus,</hi> cruel king of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and by a great Judg condemned of an unpardonable crime! who wert ſo content to change thy own life for the death of thy Wife, and couldſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of this light, after ſhe had voluntarily ſubmitted to dye, only to prolong thy days: having a heart inferior to a womans, before thou hadſt tryed the indulgence of thy parents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A meaner Victime to Misfortune than <hi>T. Gracchus,</hi> though of the Senatorian order, was <hi>C.

For hearing news of the death of his Wife, impatient of grief, he ſtab'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Sword; but by the timely coming in of his Servants being hindred from executing his purpoſe, and the wound being dreſſed and bound up, he no ſooner found his oportunity, but cutting his Swathes, and tearing open the wound again, he would not endure his ſoul oppreſt with grief to remain in his Bowels: Teſtifying by the violence of his death, what a Conjugal flame he had ſhut up in his breſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As of the ſame name, ſo endued with the ſame love, was <hi>M. Plautius.</hi> Who being commanded to return with the Confederate Navy into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> whither his Wife <hi>Oreſtella</hi> coming to viſit him, fell ſick and dyed: after ſhe was laid upon the Funeral pile, betwixt the laſt duties of anointing and kiſſing her, he fell upon his naked Sword: whom his friends, as he was in his Military Coat, and Booted, laid by his Wife. Whole Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is yet to be ſeen at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>THE LOVERS TOMB.</hi> And it is not to be queſtion'd, but that if there were any ſence left in departed Souls, that they enter'd <hi>Elyſium</hi> joyful of each others company.</p>

How much <hi>Artemiſia</hi> Queen of <hi>Caria</hi> bewailed the Death of her Husband <hi>Mauſolus,</hi> might ſeem a light thing, to the moſt exquiſite honours of all ſorts which ſhe did him, and the Magnificence of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, which became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

                     <p n="3">3. But why ſhould I rummage <hi>Aſia,</hi> why the immenſe Solitudes of Barbarous Countries, why the lurking Holes of the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea?

                  <p>LEt us now conſider the Bond of Friendſhip, potent and mighty, and no way inferiour to the ſtrength and force of the Blood. In this more certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, that this the chance of birth a fortuitous work produces; the other the uncompell'd Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, upon grounds and reaſons of ſolid judgment. And therefore it is an eaſier thing, and leſs ſubject to reprehenſion, to ſlight a Kinſman than a Friend. For the one betokens a wicked ingratefull diſpoſition, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41263:102"/>other only a levity of minde. For when the life of man lies as it were in a ſolitude, without the guard of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo neceſſary an aſſiſtance ought not unadviſedly to be choſen, but being once approved, ought not in any meaſure to be deſpiſed. But the moſt ſincere Friendſhip always appears in Adverſity; where whatever good offices are performed, proceed from a conſtant kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection. The adoration of Felicity, being to be attributed more to Flattery than Love, is full o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Suſpicion, and ſtill deſires more than it expends. For men of unſhaken fortunes more deſire friends, either for a guard, or for their ſociety. For affairs that go well and proſperouſly, as being favour'd with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Succeſs, have the leſs need of other aſſiſtance. And therefore their Memories have laſted longer in the Book of Memoires, who have deſerted their Friends in Adverſity, than theirs who have only been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Proſperity. No man talks of the familiars of <hi>Sardanapalus. Oreſtes</hi> is better known by his friend <hi>Pylades,</hi> than by <hi>Agamemnon</hi> his Father. For the Friendſhip of the one conſum'd away in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Luxury and Delight; but the mutual Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the other, in a ſad and hard condition, grew famous by the trial of their Miſeries. But why do I mention Forreigners, having firſt to do with our own Countrymen?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>T. Gracchus</hi> was eſteem'd to have been an Enemy to his Countrey, and not undeſervedly; becauſe he preferr'd his own Authority before the Welfare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Yet in this evil deſigne of his, how faithful a Friend he had of <hi>C. Bloſius</hi> of <hi>Cumae,</hi> will be worth our while to relate. An adjudged Enemy, ſuffering the higheſt Puniſhment, not permitted the honour of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, wanted not however his kindneſs. For when the Senate commanded <hi>Rupilius</hi> and <hi>Laenax</hi> the Conſuls to proceed again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> all thoſe that had been partakers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41263:102"/>with <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and that <hi>Bloſius</hi> preſented himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Laelius,</hi> to beg pardon for himſelf, urging his familiarity with <hi>Gracchus</hi> for an excuſe; when <hi>Laelius</hi> demanded of him, whether if <hi>Gracchus</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to ſet fire on the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> would be have done it? That, ſaid he, <hi>Gracchus</hi> had never commanded: He had done enough and more, for he ventur'd to defend thoſe Cuſtomes which the Senate condemn'd. But that which follows was much more confident and more dangerous; for being ſtill preſt by <hi>Laelius</hi> to make an anſwer to his queſtion, he reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted, affirming, that if <hi>Gracchus</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to burn the Temple, he would have done it. Who could have thought he had been ſo wicked, had he held his peace? Who would not have accounted him wiſe, had he been leſs free in his ſpeech, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the neceſſity of the time? But <hi>Bloſius</hi> neither with an honeſt Silence, nor with a prudent Anſwer cared to preſerve himſelf, leſt he ſhould be thought to have ſilenced the memory of his unhappy Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſame Family equally prevalent Examples of Friendſhip ariſe. For when all the Deſignes and Counſels of <hi>Gracchus</hi> were utterly defeated, and all his Conſpiracy brought to light; being deſerted of all aſſiſtance, only his two friends <hi>Pomponius</hi> and <hi>Laetorius,</hi> by interpoſing their own bodies, covered him from the Darts that fell round about him. And of theſe two, <hi>Pomponius,</hi> that he might more eaſily eſcape, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a whole body of Souldiers that eagerly purſued him at the <hi>thrice-double Gate;</hi> nor could he be moved while he lived, till at length having received many Wounds, he fell, and (though I am apt to believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly) was forced to permit them paſſage over his dead Carcaſs. <hi>Laetorius</hi> made a ſtand upon the <hi>Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41263:103"/>it with the heat of his Courage, till at length overpowr'd with the multitude, turning his ſword upon himſelf, he made a nimble jump into <hi>Tiber,</hi> and ſo periſht, ſhewing that kindneſs to the friendſhip of one perſon by his voluntary death, which <hi>Horatius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> in the ſame place, had ſhewn to his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. What renowned Souldiers might the <hi>Gracchi</hi> have had, would they have followed the courſes which their Fathers or Mothers Father had done? With what a couragious fury might <hi>Bloſius, Pomponius</hi> and <hi>Laetorius</hi> have aſſiſted them in the gaining Trophies and Triumphs, the ſtout Aſſociates of ſuch furious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes! and taking part with an inauſpicious friendſhip: but by how much the more miſerable, by ſo much are they the more certain examples of a generous fidelity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>L. Rheginus,</hi> if you examine him as to his ſincerity due to the publick, was much to be blam'd by Poſterity; If you look upon the faithful pledg of his fidelity, we are to leave him in the ſafe harbour of an applauded Conſcience. Who when <hi>Caepio</hi> Tribune of the people was thrown into Priſon, by reaſon that through his fault our Army was defeated by the <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians</hi> and <hi>Teutons,</hi> remembring the ancient friendſhip between them, ſet him at liberty; and not content to have ſhewn himſelf ſo much a friend, accompanied him alſo in his flight. O great and moſt invincible <hi>Numen</hi> friendſhip; when the Common-wealth had ſeiz'd with one hand, to pull him out of the other with thy own arm! and when ſhe requires thee to be real, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'ſt thy ſelf to baniſhment.

My deſire is to continue ſtill in the Examples of my Native Countrey, but the candor of the <hi>Roman</hi> City admoniſhes me to relate the Gallantry of other Nations. <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> inſtructed in the ſacred Secrets of <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Prudence, had contracted ſuch a faithful Friendſhip between themſelves, that when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> would have put one of them to Death, and that he that was to ſuffer had got leave to go home to his houſe, to ſettle his affairs, the other was not afraid to be Surety to the Tyrant for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. So that now he was free from the peril of Death, that had his Neck but now under the Axe; and he is now in danger, that was free before. And therefore all people waited the event of an accident ſo new and rare. The day prefix'd being come, and the party not returning; and therefore every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him of folly, that had ſo raſhly undertaken for the other; though he remain'd certain of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of his Friend: At the very Hour and Moment which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> prefixed, the other appeared. The Tyrant admiring the Courage of both, gave a full

Such is the power of Friendſhip, to beget contempt of Death, take away the ſweet deſire of Life, tame Cruelty, turn Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Love, and to reward Puniſhment with Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: to which there is almoſt as much worſhip due, as to the Ceremonies of the Gods.

And I do not doubt but it may become me to think my <hi>Pompey</hi> to be like <hi>Alexander;</hi> while he will have
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41263:105"/>his <hi>Epheſtion</hi> to be another <hi>Alexander.</hi> And therefore I ſhould be lyable to a very great errour, to paſs over the Example of conſtant and kind Friendſhip, without any mention of him: in whoſe minde, as in the breaſt of moſt loving Parents, my proſperous condition of Life hath flouriſh'd, my Misfortunes have remain'd contented. From whom I have received all increaſe of profit freely offer'd; by whom I have ſtood more firmly againſt miſhap; who by his own proſperous Conduct and good Omens, hath render'd our Studies more pleaſant and delightful. And therefore I fed the envy of ſome with the loſs of my beſt friend, dividing my kindneſs, ſuch as it was, to ſome that knew not how to make uſe of it. But there is no Proſperity ſo modeſt, that can eſcape the teeth of Envy. But in what retirement are ſome to be avoided, with what allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of kindneſs canſt thou reſtrain their inveteracy? There is no remedy but they will rejoyce and be tickled at the misfortunes of others, as well as at their own good. They are rich in the Loſſes, wealthy in the Calamities, immortal in the Death of other men. But while they inſult over the miſeries of others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in their own, let them have a care of the beſt revenger of their Inſolency, the Variety of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Condition,</p>

                  <p>LEt us recal our work, that had ſtraid in a pious Digreſſion, in expoſing our own diſcontents, to its former courſe, and now take <hi>Liberality</hi> into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which hath two probable Fountains, true Judgment, and honeſt Benevolence. For when it ſprings from theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> then only is it duely founded: A Gift being acceptable for its greatneſs, but ſomewhat more efficacious, when it is reaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Beyond the price of the thing, we find a moſt ineſtimable moment of an opportunity, which with the expence of a ſmall ſum of Money rendr'd <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> highly applauded ſo many Ages ſince. He had received the Captives from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> upon a Contract for ſo much Money. Which when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would not ſtand to, ſending his Son to the City, he ſold the only Farm which he had in the world, and preſently ſent <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Money. If we conſider the Sum, but ſmall, as being the price but of ſeven Acres of Land, and thoſe lying in <hi>Pupinia;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Soul of the Giver, a moſt large ſum, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41263:106"/>far exceeding the Money. For he would rather want his Patrimony, than that his Countrey ſhould be poor in Credit. So much the more to be commended, as it is a more certain ſigne of a real meaning, to ſtretch beyond ability, rather than to do the ſame act out of ſuperfluity. For the one can do what he performs, the other more than he is able.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore a Woman of the ſame time, <hi>Buſa</hi> by name, the richeſt in the Countrey of <hi>Apulia,</hi> won her ſelf an ample teſtimony of Liberality; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not ſo great, if we compare her flowing Riches to the Poverty of the <hi>Fabians.</hi> For though ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved about Ten Thouſand of our Citizens, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> within the Walls of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſium,</hi> yet ſhe ſhewed her ſelf munificent to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> without prejudice to her Eſtate. But <hi>Fabius</hi> for the good of his Countrey exchang'd Poverty for Want.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We finde alſo in <hi>Quinctus Conſidius</hi> a moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Example of Liberality, not without ſome profit to himſelf. Who when the Fury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Catiline</hi> had put all the Commonwealth into ſuch a tumult, that the Rich themſelves, the Rents of Poſſeſſions falling, were not able to pay their Creditors; he having the Sum of one Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Seſterces at uſe, would not ſuffer any of his Debtors to be call'd upon, either for Principal or Intereſt: and as much as in him lay, ſweetned the bitterneſs of publick Confuſion by his own private Quiet: opportunely teſtifying, that he made profit only of his Money, not of Civil Blood. Now they who act with rigour in buſineſs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they carry bloody Money home, may hence learn to know, with what an accurſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious joy they rejoyce, if they do not loath to read the Decree of the Senate, which gave <hi>Conſidius</hi> publick thanks.</p>

The ſame Senate, when they heard that <hi>Pruſias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> was come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate their Victory over <hi>Perſeus,</hi> ſent <hi>Cornelius Scipio,</hi> then Queſtor, to meet him as far as <hi>Capua:</hi> and ordered that the beſt Houſe in <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be hired for him; and that he and his Retinue ſhould be entertain'd at the Publick Charge. And indeed in the reception of that great King, the whole City ſeem'd to have the countenance but of one entire Friend. So that he, who came an entire friend to our City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with a double affection for us. Neither was <hi>Egypt</hi> ignorant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clemency: For King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being thrown out of his Kingdom by his younger Brother, and coming to <hi>Rome</hi> with a ſmall Attendance, and in a mean Habit, to crave aid of the Senate, took a Lodging in the houſe of an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Painter. Which when the Senate underſtood, ſending for the Young man, they made a very great excuſe, for not having ſent the Queſtor to meet him after the antient Cuſtome, and for not providing entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him; as not happening through their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, but through his ſuddain and private Entry. After which they accompanied him to a publick Houſe, deſiring him to lay by his mean Habit, and fix them a day to wait on him. They alſo took care to ſend him Gifts by the Queſtor every day; and by theſe degrees of kindneſs advanced him from Expulſion to the Royal Throne. So that he had more hope in the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, than fear of his own Misfortune.</p>

                     <hi>Olbia,</hi> for the relief of which <hi>Anno</hi> Captain of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> valiantly fighting was ſlain, buried his Body out of his own Tent, beſtowing a noble Funeral upon it. Nor was he aſham'd to appear at the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of an Enemy, believing that his Victory would be the leſs envied both by Gods and Men, when there was ſo much of Humanity mix'd with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Quinctius Criſpinus,</hi> whoſe Gentleneſs and mild Diſpoſition, the potent Affections of Anger and Glory could not diſturb? He had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with great civility <hi>Badius</hi> of <hi>Campania</hi> at his houſe, and with great care recovered him from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sickneſs: Who after the revolt of the <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> provoking <hi>Criſpinus</hi> to fight with him at the head of the Army; <hi>Criſpinus,</hi> who knew himſelf to be above him both in Strength and Courage, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give him good councel than to overcome him. <hi>What doſt thou go about to do, Madman,</hi> ſaid he? <hi>Or whither do thy fooliſh deſires carry thee?

Couldſt thou finde none among all the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>upon whom to exerciſe thy villanous arms, but only</hi> Quinctius, <hi>to whoſe Houſhold-gods thou oweſt both a return of honour and ſafety? The League of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and our Hoſpitable Gods, with us ſacred Pledges, though with you of no accompt, will not ſuffer me to combat with thee. Nay, if in the ſhock of both Armies, I ſhould have known thee overturned by the force of my Buckler, I would have recalled my Sword from thy Neck. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is thy crime, that thou didſt intend to kill a Gueſt; but the Death of a Gueſt ſhall not be mine. And therefore ſeek out ſome body elſe for the courage of thy right hand, for mine has learnt to ſave.</hi> But Heaven gave to both a deſerved Iſſue; for <hi>Badius</hi> was ſlain in the fight, <hi>Quinctius</hi> valiantly fighting came ſafe off with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

Who after he had taken <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> from the Caſtle took a view of the City below, once flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now almoſt ruin'd in Miſery: he beholding the miſerable ſtate thereof, could not refrain from Tears. So that if ſome perſon that knew him not had beheld him, he might have been thought the Looſer, not the Victor. This conſolation hadſt thou in thy calamity, fair City, that though it was not lawful for thee to ſtand ſafe, yet thy fall was gentle under ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Quintus Metellus</hi> warring in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> lying at the Siege of <hi>Centobricum,</hi> when the Engine was fix'd, and he was juſt ready to beat down that part of the Wall which was fitteſt to be batter'd, preferr'd Clemency before an approaching Victory. For when the <hi>Centobricenſes</hi> had oppoſed the Sons of <hi>Rhetogenes,</hi> who had fled to him, againſt all the ſhot of the Engine, leſt the Children ſhould be cruelly kill'd in the ſight of their Father (though <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes</hi> himſelf bid him not fear to go on with his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery for all that) he rais'd his Siege. By which act of Clemency, though he took not one City, yet he took the hearts of all the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and thereby ſo far prevailed, as not to want many Hoſtages to keep them faithful to the <hi>Roman</hi> people.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

The <hi>Romans</hi> believing theſe to be the greateſt fruits of Victory, to reſtore the Temples their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Kings their Kindred.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Nor is the Memory of <hi>L.

Range the Army in view, which conquer'd <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and the Story which I have related, it may be doubted which ſight would be moſt delectable. For though it be a renowned thing to overcome an Enemy, yet is it no leſs praiſe-worthy to take compaſſion of him in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This Humanity of <hi>L. Paulus</hi> teaches me not to forget the Clemency of <hi>Cn. Pompey:</hi> Who having overthrown <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who not only made cruel Wars with the <hi>Romans</hi> himſelf, but alſo protected <hi>Mithridates,</hi> a moſt inveterate Enemy to our City, would not ſuffer him to lye proſtrate at his

Who therefore conſidering not the quality, but the age of both, deſcends from his ſeat, and with thoſe hands with which he had ſubdued the wealth of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> takes the benumm'd Souldier and leads him to his own ſeat, ſaying, <hi>That that would be wholeſome to him, which was Capital among the</hi> Perſians, <hi>to ſit in the Kings Chair.</hi> What wonder then if they thought it a pleaſure to ſerve ſuch a Captain ſo many years, to whom the ſafety of a Common Souldier was more dear than the grandeur of his own Perſon? The ſame Perſonage alſo yielding not to any Mortal, but to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, though faint with the violence of his diſtemper, yet leaning upon his Elbow, he reacht out his right Hand to all that would take their leaves of him. Who would not run to embrace that hand, which now oppreſt by Fate, ſufficed to embrace an Army, with an Humanity as vivacious as his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Humanity is of no robuſt nature, yet we may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41263:112"/>declare the Clemency of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Athens.</hi> Who when a Youngman inflamed with the Love of his Daughter, meeting her in the Street, kiſt her; and being therefore deſired by his Wife to puniſh him, made anſwer, <hi>If we puniſh thoſe that love us, what muſt we do to thoſe that hate us?</hi> A worthy Saying; to which we muſt adde, that it came out of the mouth of a Tyrant.</p>
                     <p>Thus he took the affront offered his Daughter; thus the injury done to himſelf more commendably. For being inceſſantly taunted and reviled by his friend <hi>Thraſippus</hi> at Table, he ſo reſtrained his anger and his tongue, as if he had been one of the Guard reviled by the Tyrant: and as he went away, thinking he had retired ſooner than ordinary for fear, he kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to ſtay. <hi>Thraſippus</hi> being in the heat of his drink, ſpit all in his face, and yet he could not move him to revenge. He pull'd away his Sons alſo, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to intercede for the abuſes of him that was their Father. The next morning when <hi>Thraſippus</hi> intended to puniſh himſelf with a violent death, the Tyrant came to him, and giving him his faith that he ſhould ſtill remain in the ſame degree of favour with him, kept him from the execution of his purpoſe.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41263:113"/>their Drunkenneſs, and ſimple confeſſion of the truth, turn'd the Kings Anger into laughter; by which Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his he ſo far prevailed, that the ſober <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> gave him thanks, and thoſe that had been drunk wiſh'd him well. The ſame height of Humanity cauſed him to ſend <hi>Mico</hi> with a Convoy for the greater ſafety of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadours, whom he heard were coming toward him for the redemption of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. And for their more honourable reception, he himſelf with a Body of Horſe richly attired went out of the Camp to meet them. Not ſo much corrupted with the ſucceſs of Proſperity, as ſo hinder all proſpect of reſpect from them with whom he was at greateſt Enmity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of which mild temper he received the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the laſt hour of his death. For when he had invaded the City of <hi>Argos</hi> with moſt diſmal Omens, and that <hi>Alcyoneus</hi> the Son of King <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> had brought his head cut off, with great joy, as a moſt happy act of Victory to his Father, labouring in the defence of the City; <hi>Antigonus</hi> rebuking his Son for inſulting over the ruine of ſo great a man, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of humane Calamity, took up his Head from the ground, and cover'd it with the Hood wherewith his own head was cover'd, after the manner of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> and cauſed it, being return'd to the body, to be honourably burnt. And when his Son <hi>Helenus</hi> was brought a priſoner to him, he commanded him to bear a Royal Minde, and to continue his Regal Habit, and moreover gave him the bones of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> incloſed in a Golden Cheſt, to carry into his Countrey of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to his Brother <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Campanians</hi> alſo, when our Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the <hi>Samnites</hi> to paſs under Gallowſes at <hi>Caudium,</hi> entring their City not only unarmed but naked, received them as kindly as if they had enter'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41263:113"/>in Triumph, bearing the Spoils of their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Immediately preſenting the Conſul with all the Enſignes of his Honour, and beſtowing upon the Souldiers Cloaths, Arms, Horſes and Proviſion, taking away the want and deformity of the <hi>Roman</hi> overthrow. Had they been as conſtant againſt <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they had not given an occaſion for the rage of the cruel Axes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Having made mention of a moſt bitter Enemy, with thoſe actions or kindneſs which he performed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhall make an end of the ſubject in hand. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> having ſought the body of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius Paulus</hi> ſlain at <hi>Cannae,</hi> with all diligence, as much as in him lay, would not permit it to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried. He alſo cauſed the body of <hi>T. Gracchus,</hi> who fell unhappily into the ambuſhment of the <hi>Lucans,</hi> to be honourably buried, and deliver'd his bones, to be carried into his own Countrey, to our Souldiers. When <hi>Marcellus</hi> was ſlain in the Countrey of the <hi>Brutii,</hi> while with more eagerneſs than conſideration he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſpy the actions of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he ſought him out, and laid him upon the Funeral Pile, clad in a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Jacket, and adorn'd with a Crown of Gold. And therefore the ſweetneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity penetrates into the very breaſts of rude Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, mollifies the cruel and ſevere eyes of Enemies, and bends the moſt inſolent pride of Victory. Nor is it a difficult thing for Clemency to finde an eaſie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through hoſtile Weapons, and Swords drawn hand to hand. It overcomes Anger, throws down Rage, and mingles hoſtile Blood with hoſtile Tears. Which produced that admirable Speech of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> delivering his judgment at the Funerals of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains. Wherefore <hi>Paulus, Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> brought him more honour by their Funerals, than by their Deaths. For he deceived them with his <hi>Punic</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41263:114"/>ſubtilty, but honoured them with his <hi>Roman</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. And you, brave and pious Souls, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Obſequies not to be repented of; for as you fell more deſirably in your Countrey, more nobly for your Countrey; ſo ye recover'd the honour of that laſt office due to ye, which by misfortune ye had loſt.</p>

                  <p>NExt let us take a view of the grateful and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects and actions of the Minde, that Vertue and Vice may receive their due reward, from a due eſtimate of the value of either. However, becauſe they are diſtinguiſhed by contrary ends and deſignes, we alſo intend to ſeparate them in writing: And therefore let us begin with thoſe things, that rather deſerve praiſe than reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And that we may take our riſe from publick Acts, let us take into our conſideration <hi>Marcius Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> who invading his own Country, and having
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41263:114"/>brought a very great Army of the <hi>Volſci</hi> to the very Gates of the City, threatning the utter deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; yet at the interceſſion of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vituria,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Volumnia,</hi> he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to give over his violent Enterpriſe. In me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof the Senate gave very great Priviledges to the <hi>Order of Matrons.</hi> For they order'd that men ſhould give the upper hand to Women in the ſtreet, as acknowledging the Womens Garm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt to have been a greater ſafety to their City than their Arms: They added alſo a new diſtinction of Coifs to the adornments of their Ears; they alſo permitted them to wear Purple and Gold Laces; and more then all this, they erected a Temple and an Altar to Womens Fortune, juſt in the ſame place where <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s wrath was appeaſed, to teſtifie their grateful acknowledgment of ſo great a benefit, by their religious reſpect and reverence that they had of it.</p>
                  <p>For which the Senate was no leſs famous at the time of the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War: For when <hi>Capua</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Fulvius,</hi> there were two Women in the Town that would by no means be perſwaded from ſhewing eminent ſignes of good Will toward the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> the one named <hi>Veſtia Opidia</hi> the Miſtriſs of a good Family, the other <hi>Cluvia Facula</hi> an Harlot; one which dayly ſacrificed for the ſucceſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, the other ſtill ſupplied the neceſſities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captives. The Town being taken, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſtor'd them both their Liberty and their Goods; and if they had any other Boon to crave, bid them freely demand it, for that they were as free to give it. It was more wonderful that the Senate had leiſure, in a time of ſo much Exultation, to return thanks to two mean Women, than that they took upon them to do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What more commendable than that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:41263:115"/>Youth, who in the Conſulſhip of <hi>C.

A new thing, to hear the whole Army liſting themſelves, leſt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhould ſeem to want a grateful mind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A great Example of Gratitude was that of the People toward <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus:</hi> Who dying after he had born Five Conſulſhips, with great ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="4">4. With no ſmall glory was another piece of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhewn to the other <hi>Fabius,</hi> yet living. For when <hi>Minutius,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, was made equal in Commiſſion with him being Dictator, by an Act of the Senate, which was never done before, and dividing the Army had fought apart with <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Samni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> yet he ſeeing the great Overthrow he had like to have had by his own Raſhneſs, had not <hi>Fabius</hi> come in timely to his relief, he preſently acknowledged him for his Father, and commanded him to be ſaluted Patron and Preſerver by his own Legions; and laying down his Commiſſion of Equality, ſubmitted the Maſterſhip of the Horſe to the Dictatorſhip, as of right it ought to have been; correcting the impudent errour of the Vulgar, by the grateful ſignification of his Minde.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Story to be related upon as good grounds, is, that <hi>Terentius Culeo,</hi> a Pretorian by Birth, and of the Senatorian Order, ſhould follow as he did the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot of the Elder <hi>Scipio,</hi> with his Cap in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41263:115"/>his hand bare-headed, for that being a Captive to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he had been retaken by him. And therefore he deſervedly return'd, in view of the whole people, the acknowledgment of a Benefit received from him, as from his Patron, who was the Author of his Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But when <hi>Flaminius</hi> triumph'd over <hi>Philip,</hi> there was not only one, but two thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens that followed his Chariot bare-headed; who having been taken in the <hi>Punic</hi> Wars, and being ſold into <hi>Greece,</hi> had been by his care collected together and reſtor'd to their former Freedome. The Honour of the General ſeem'd redoubled that day, who at the ſame time let the People ſee their Enemies by him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, their Fellow Citizens by him preſerved: Alſo their preſervation was doubly acceptable to all, ſeeing that ſo many, and thoſe ſo grateful perſons, had recovered their deſerved Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Metellus,</hi> as famous for his Tears as others for their Victories, obtain'd the name of <hi>Pious,</hi> for his paſſionate and conſtant Love of his Father in Exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This man being Conſul, was not aſhamed to entreat the People on the behalf of <hi>Q. Calidius,</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for the Pretorſhip, becauſe that he being Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, was author of the Law by which his Father was recall'd. He always after call'd him alſo the Patron of his Houſe and Family. Nor did he thereby any way derogate from his greatneſs which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; ſeeing that it was not the Lowneſs of his Spirit, but the Gratefulneſs of his Minde, which made him ſubmit the grandeur of his Dignity to the greateſt deſert of an inferiour perſon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And therefore the Gratitude of <hi>C. Marius</hi> was not only eminent, but ſeem'd to be the effect of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion: For obſerving two Cohorts of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertians</hi> to have bravely withſtood the Fury of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41263:116"/>
                     <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> contrary to the Condition of the League, he immediately made them free of the City. Which act of his he both truely and nobly excuſed, ſaying, <hi>That in the noiſe and hurry of Battle, he could not hear the words of the Civil Law.</hi> And indeed it was a time then, wherein there was more need to defend, than hear the Law.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Sylla</hi> in the Combat of Praiſe every where fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the footſteps of <hi>Marius.</hi> For being <hi>Dictator,</hi> he not only uncovered his Head to <hi>Pompey</hi> being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon; but riſing in his Chariot, did alight from his Horſe. And this in the Publick Aſſembly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to have done willingly, remembring that the other when he was but two and twenty years of Age had taken his part, with his Fathers Army. There were many remarkable things in <hi>Pompey,</hi> but I know not whether any thing hapned to him more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than this, that the ſurpluſage of his kindneſs cauſed <hi>Sylla</hi> at length to forget him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And while we talk of Men in high Splendour, let there be ſome place for meaner Gratitude. For <hi>Cornutus</hi> the Pretor being commanded to bargain for the Funerals of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa;</hi> they who provided all Neceſſaries for Funerals, belonging to the Temple of <hi>Libitina,</hi> promiſed the uſe of their things and their attendance <hi>gratis;</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by their conſtant and earneſt deſire procured, that the ordering of the Funeral might be at the rate of <hi>Seſterce</hi> Money, though at their own charges. Whoſe praiſe, ſetting the Law aſide, their condition rather augments than extenuates; ſeeing them the only contemners of gain, that lived by no other thing than gain.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Darius</hi> being yet a private perſon, was mightily taken with a ſhort Veſtment of <hi>Syloſon</hi> the <hi>Samian;</hi> and by his more curious viewing of it, caus'd <hi>Syloſon</hi> to give it him freely, who ſo much deſir'd it in his mind. But how great a value he put upon that ſmall Gift, he ſoon made known when he enjoyed the Empire, giving to <hi>Syloſon</hi> the whole City and Iſland of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> for his poſſeſſion. Not that he honour'd the price, but the opportunity and ſeaſon of the Gift; and rather conſider'd from whom the Gift came, than to whom it was given.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Magnificently grateful alſo was King <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who made an exchange of all his Priſoners taken from the Enemy, for one <hi>Leonicus</hi> a moſt ſtout pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of his own perſon from eminent danger, who was taken in a Sea-fight by the <hi>Rhodians:</hi> accompting it more noble to give his moſt bitter Enemies an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than to be unmindful of one that had ſo well deſerved of him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. More liberal yet were the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for they gave all <hi>Aſia</hi> for a Gift to King <hi>Attalus.</hi> Though <hi>Attalus</hi> was not behinde-hand in the Juſtice of his laſt Will and Teſtament, by which he return'd it to them all back again. So that the Munificence of the one, and the Gratitude of the other, cannot be ſet down

                     <p n="4">4. Nor can I tell whether the breaſt of <hi>Maſſaniſa</hi> were not in as high a meaſure replete with the pledges of Gratitude. For he by the benefit of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and the <hi>Roman</hi> friendſhip being put into the poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſion of a very large Kingdome, by a moſt conſtant and loyal Amity continued the memory of that noble Gift to the very end of his life, which he enjoyed to a very great age. Inſomuch that not only all <hi>Africa,</hi> but all other Nations knew him to be more faithful to the Family of the <hi>Cornelii,</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to himſelf. He, though he were very hard put to it by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians;</hi> and was hardly able to defend his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, deliver'd to <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> Nephew to the other <hi>Scipio,</hi> the greateſt part of the <hi>Numidian</hi> Army, when he was ſent for into <hi>Spain</hi> to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> preferring former benefits before the preſent danger. He now near his end, leaving great Riches and Fifty Sons behind him, beſought <hi>M. V. Manlius,</hi> then Proconſul in <hi>Africa,</hi> to ſend <hi>Scipio Aemilianus</hi> who then was under his command to him; believing he ſhould die more happy, could he but commit his laſt words and breath to his Embraces. But his death preventing the coming of <hi>Scipio,</hi> he gave in charge to his Wife and Children to acknowledge but one people in the world, the <hi>Romans;</hi> and but one Family among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. That he left all entire to <hi>Aemilianus,</hi> giving him the ſole power of making a diviſion, and that whatever he ordained, they ſhould obſerve as inviolable, as if he had left it by Will. Thus died <hi>Maſſaniſa,</hi> having prolong'd his life through many and divers varieties of changes to the hundredth year.

THe Senate placed by the Parent of our City in the higheſt degree of Honour, yet miſerably tore him in pieces in the Senate-Houſe; and thought it no crime to take away his Life, who had given life to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. That rude and fierce Age con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with the Blood of their <hi>Founder,</hi> the known Piety of poſterity cannot diſſemble.</p>

                     <hi>Camillus,</hi> the moſt triumphant Enlarger, and the moſt certain Defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, yet could not preſerve himſelf in his own City, whoſe ſafeguard he had eſtabliſh'd, encreas'd and enlarg'd. For being accuſed by <hi>L. Apuleius</hi> Tribune of the People, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving embezled the Spoils of the <hi>Veientines,</hi> he was by a hard, and as I may ſay Iron Sentence, condemn'd and ſent into Exilement. And at ſuch a time, when having loſt a moſt hopeful Son, he was rather to have been relieved with Comfort, than to have been laden with Calamities. But his Countrey unmindful of the extraordinary Merits of ſo great a Perſon, heap'd the affliction of Exilement upon the loſs of his Son. Poorly done, for Fifteen thouſand Pence (a pitiful Sum) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of ſo great a Prince. The Elder <hi>African,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was almoſt quite broken by the Arms of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when ſhe lay bleeding to death, and bleeding out the very laſt drop, reſtored her again, and made her Miſtreſs of all <hi>Africa;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence whereof, his Countrey-men confined him to a poor Village near a ſtinking Lake; of which he ſeem'd to be ſenſible to his death, cauſing this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to be put upon his Tomb: <hi>INGRATEF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTREY, THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> HAST NOT SO M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH AS MY BONES.</hi> What more unworthy the neceſſity which they put him to, what more juſt than his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or more moderate than his revenge? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his aſhes to a City, which he had preſerved from being reduced to aſhes. Therefore was this revenge a greater unkindneſs to ungrateful <hi>Rome,</hi> than the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which <hi>Coriolanus</hi> offer'd to it. For he onely affrighted <hi>Rome,</hi> this man made <hi>Rome</hi> aſhamed: not being willing, ſuch was his piety, to complain of their Severity, till after his Death. For, no queſtion, it was a kind of comfort to him, that his Brother had ſuffered the ſame before; who after he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown

                  <p>No leſs inferiour in Vertue was the Younger <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> nor yet more fortunate in his end. For after he had quite reduced to nothing two Cities, <hi>Numantia</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> both threatning deſtruction to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, met with his murtherer at home, but not with one to revenge his death in all the <hi>Forum.</hi> Who can be ignorant that <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> was as famous for Counſel, as the other two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were for War? Who kept <hi>T.

But <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> betrayed not his Accuſer, but his Protector, to the cut-throat hand of his moſt inveterate adverſary: if for fear of death, unworthy of life; if for hope of reward, moſt worthy of death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To repeat another Example of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>M. Cicero</hi> had defended <hi>C. Popilius Lenas</hi> of the Countrey of <hi>Picena,</hi> with no leſs Care than Eloquence, when his Cauſe was very doubtful. This <hi>Popilius</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being neither in word or deed injur'd by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> of his own accord begg'd of <hi>M.

And thus laden with the head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, and the moſt famous right hand of Peace, he return'd with joy to the City, as if he had brought along with him the Spoils of ſome Enemy.

A ſad Inheritance for the Son of ſo great a Captain, who was himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the greateſt Captains of that Age. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> alſo, who was the Rule of Juſtice all over <hi>Greece,</hi> and the greateſt example of Continence that ever was, was commanded to depart his Countrey. Happy <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> could they have found out any one that had been either a Good Man, or a Lover of his Countrey, after this man was gone, with whom Sanctity itſelf ſeem'd to go along! <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was a notable example of all that had experience of the Ingratitude of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: For when he had ſetled <hi>Athens</hi> in Peace, and raiſed it to be the moſt famous, the moſt wealthy, the Miſtriſs of all <hi>Greece,</hi> he found his Countrey-men ſo incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41263:120"/>him, that he was forc'd to flie to the mercy of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> whom he had ruin'd before. <hi>Phocion,</hi> who was endow'd with two qualities which are the beſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe Wrath and Fury, I mean Eloquence and Integrity, was forced by the <hi>Athenians</hi> to fly his Countrey: and when he was dead, he was not permitted ſo much as one turf of <hi>Athenian</hi> land to cover his bones. Certainly then it muſt be lookt upon as a publick piece of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by common conſent, to puniſh the greateſt Vertues as the greateſt Crimes: which not being to be any where endured, ought to have been more eſpecially exploded and abominated in <hi>Athens,</hi> where there is a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ingratitude. And not without reaſon, becauſe he looſes and aboliſhes the commerce of doing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Benefits, which is the ſupport of human Life, that neglects to return Kindneſs for Kindneſs. How ſeverely therefore are they to be reprehended, who having moſt juſt Laws, but being very wickedly encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rather chooſe to obey their deprav'd manners, than their Laws? So that if it could happen, that thoſe great Perſons, whoſe misfortunes I have related, could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any other Cities, d'ye think they would not quickly have ſilenced thoſe talkative People, as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious as they were? <hi>Marathon</hi> glitters with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Trophies; <hi>Salamis</hi> and <hi>Artemiſium</hi> beheld the Ruine of <hi>Xerxes</hi> Navy: Thoſe Walls that were pull'd down, riſe more glorious from their ruines.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> a perſon of a vaſt Courage and deep
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41263:121"/>in Counſel, and well deſerving of his Countrey, yet almoſt ruin'd under the oppreſſion of an unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, fl d to the <hi>Volſci,</hi> who were Enemies to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> For Vertue gets eſteem wherever it goes. So that where he only ſought for refuge, in a ſhort time he obtain'd the chief command of all things. And it hapned that he, who was by the <hi>Romans</hi> refuſed for their Leader, had like to have proved their moſt fatal Enemy. For the <hi>Volſci</hi> having often overcome our Armies, by his Conduct and Valour, came up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt the very walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> For this reaſon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were ſo haughty, as not to value their own happineſs, were forced to ſupplicate an Exile, whoſe offence they would not pardon before. Embaſſadors were ſent to appeaſe him, but they could do no good: the Prieſts went in their religious Habits, but returned without obtaining any favour: The Senators were at their Wits end, the People trembled both Men and Women bewail'd their approaching Calamity. But then <hi>Veturia Coriolanus</hi>'s Mother, taking along with her <hi>Volumnia</hi> his Wife, and Children alſo, went to the Camp of the <hi>Volſci:</hi> Whom aſſoon as h r Son eſpied, <hi>O my Countrey, thou haſt overcome my anger,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by vertue of this Womans tears, and for the Wombs ſake that bare me, I forgive thee, though my enemy;</hi> and immediately he withdrew his Army from the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories.

                  <p n="2">2. The ſame Piety inflam'd the Elder <hi>Africanus,</hi> hardly paſt the age of Childhood, to the ſuccour of his Father, and arm'd him with manly ſtrength in the midſt of the Battle.

                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe famous Examples the City only received by hearſay; theſe they beheld with their eyes. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius</hi> the Tribune had accuſed <hi>T. Manlius Imperioſſus</hi> to the People, for that he had exceeded his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of hopes of making an end of the War, and for ſending away his Son, which was a perſon of very great hopes, from publick employment, to follow his own coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ey-affairs. Which when <hi>Manlius</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, he came to the City, and went by break of day to <hi>Pomponius</hi>'s Houſe; who believing that he came to aggravate his Fathers Crimes, by whom he had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> uſed, commanded all the people out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he might the more freely take his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Son having thereby got an opportunity ſo ſit for his turn, drew his Sword which he had brought privately under his Coat, compell'd the threatned and terrified Conſul to ſwear, that he would forbear any farther proſecution of his Father: So that <hi>Imperioſſus</hi> never came to his Trial. Piety toward mild Parents is commendable: But <hi>Manlius,</hi> the more ſevere to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is Father was, the greater praiſe he merited, by the aſſiſtance which he gave him; being invited by no allurement of Indulgence, but only natural Affection to love him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This ſort of Piety did <hi>M. Cotta</hi> imitate, the very ſame day that he put on the Coat of Manhood; when aſſoon as he deſcended out of the Capitol, he accuſed <hi>Carbo</hi> who had condemn'd his Father, and being condemn'd proſecuted him to puniſhment; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41263:122"/>his early Youth, and firſt attempt in publick buſineſs, with a famous action.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Paternal Authority was equally reverenced by <hi>C. Flaminius.</hi> For when he being a popular Tribune had publiſh'd a Law for dividing the <hi>Gallick</hi> Land to every particular man, in oppoſition to the Senate, and quite againſt their wills, contemning both their threats and entreaties, and not at all terrified with the threats of an Army, which they menaced to raiſe againſt him, if he perſiſted in his obſtinacy; was got into the Pulpit for Orations, reading his Law to the People; yet when his Father pull'd him away, he came down obedient to Paternal Command: no man murmuring in the leaſt to ſee him break off in the midſt of his Speech.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe were great effects of Manly Piety; but I cannot tell whether the act of <hi>Claudia</hi> the Veſtal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, were not as forcible and as couragious. Who, when ſhe ſaw her Father pull'd out of his Triumphal Chariot, by the rude hand of a Tribune, with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful celerity interpoſing her ſelf between them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the higheſt Authority in the City, inflamed with Anger and Malice. So that the Father rode in Triumph to the Capitol, the Daughter to the Temple of <hi>Veſta.</hi> Nor could it be righty decided to which moſt praiſe was due, whether to him whom Victory, or her whom Piety attended.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Pardon me moſt antient Hearths, pardon me eternal Fires, if the context of our work lead us from your moſt ſacred Temple, to the more neceſſary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than magnificent part of the City. For no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, no Poverty cheapens the price of Piety. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the trial of it is the more certain, by how much the more miſerable. The Pretor had delivered to the Triumvir a noble Woman to be put to death in Priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being condemned for ſome hainous Crime. But the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41263:123"/>Keeper, compaſſionating her caſe, did not ſtrangle her preſently. All the while he gave her Daughter liberty to come to her, after he had diligently ſearch'd that ſhe carried her no food, believing that in a little time ſhe might be ſtarv'd to death. But ſeeing her live many days without any alteration, he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelf by what means ſhe kept herſelf alive; thereupon more diligently watching her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he obſerv'd her giving her Breaſt to her Mother, and pacifying the rage of her hunger with her Nipples. The novelty of which wonderful ſight, being by him related to the Triumvir, by the Triumvir to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by the Pretor to the Council of the Judges, they granted the Woman her pardon. What will nor Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety invent, that for the preſervation of a Parent in priſon, found out ſo ſtrange a means as this? For what more unuſual, what more unheard-of, than that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be nouriſhed by the Breaſts of a Child? One would think this were againſt the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that Nature commands us in the firſt place to love our Parents.</p>

Therefore is Nature the firſt and beſt Miſtreſs of Piety, which neither wanting the help of Speech, nor the uſe of Letters, through her own ſilent and proper Power infuſes Charity into the breaſts of Children. What is then the profit of Learning? That their Wits ſhould be more polite, but not more honeſt. For true Vertue is rather born than acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <p>NExt to this kind of Piety follows <hi>Fraternal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</hi> For as it may be accompted the firſt Bond of Friendſhip, to have received many and great Benefits; the next tye is, that we have received them together. For how abundantly pleaſant is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe things! Before I was born I liv'd in the ſame Houſe, My Infancy lay in the ſame Cradle, The ſame Perſons were Parents to both, The ſame Vows were made for both, and we enjoy the ſame honour by our extraction. A Wife is dear to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Children dear to a Parent, Friends are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Acquaintance are delightful; but when you have read what follows, there is no Benevolence that exceeds Brotherly Loving Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And this I ſpeak by the teſtimony of <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> who though he had contracted a moſt ſtrict Friendſhip with <hi>Laelius,</hi> yet he beſought the Senate that they would not transfer to him his Brothers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Lot which they had taken from him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to go himſelf Lieutenant to his Brother: So that the Elder became inferiour to the Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſtout and couragious to the faint-hearted, the renowed to a perſon of no fame; and, which is more, he that was already <hi>Africanus,</hi> to him that was not yet <hi>Aſiaticus.</hi> So that he aſſumed one of the moſt noble Sirnames, and gave the other. He received the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41263:125"/>Coat of one Triumph, and gave the other; greater by aſſiſtance, than his Brother by Superiority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But <hi>Marcus Fabius</hi> the Conſul having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the <hi>Veientes</hi> and <hi>Hetruſci,</hi> in a moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fight, would not accept of a Triumph, which was offer'd him with the full conſent of the Senate, and eager deſire of the People; becauſe his Brother, a perſon of Conſular Dignity, was kill'd bravely fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Battle. How great was the zeal of Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Charity that was lodg'd in that breaſt, that could not be extinguiſh'd by the ſplendour of ſo high an honour?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For this Example Antiquity is famous; that which follows has been no ſmall Ornament to our Age, who have had the honour to ſee the Fraternal Yoak of the <hi>Claudian</hi> and now alſo the Glory of the <hi>Julian</hi> Family. For ſo great a Love had our Prince and Parent for his Brother <hi>Druſus,</hi> that when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at <hi>Ticinum,</hi> whither he came a Conquerour to embrace his Parents, that his Brother <hi>Druſus</hi> lay dangerous ſick in <hi>Germany,</hi> in a frightful amaze he flew out of Town. And the Journey which he made appears from hence to have been ſo ſwift, as if he had rode it at one breath; for paſſing the <hi>Alpes</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he poſted day and night, changing his Horſes, above two hundred Miles, through ſeveral barbarous Nations but newly conquer'd, in the company of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabagius</hi> only, who was his guide. But in all that hazard and danger, when he had forſaken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men, the moſt ſacred name of Piety, and the Gods that are the favourers of all laudable Vertues, even <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, the faithful Preſerver of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, accompanied him. <hi>Druſus</hi> alſo faint and weak, at that very moment when there is little or no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made between Life and Death, ordered the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41263:125"/>Legions with their Enſignes to go and meet his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He alſo order'd a Praetorium to be erected for him upon the right hand, and would make him take the Conſular and Imperial Dignity: and at the ſame time he ſubmitted to the Majeſty of his Brother, and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roak of Death. Nor can any preſident of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love be compar'd to theſe, unleſs it be the Examplar of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. However it cannot be a diſhonour to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the moſt famous Emperours, to mention here the ſtrange Love of a certain Souldier toward his Brother. For he being in pay under <hi>Pompey,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlain a Soldier under <hi>Sertorius,</hi> that preſs'd him very hard; when he came to ſtrip him, and found him to be his own Brother, curſing the Gods for giving him the Victory, he carried him near the Camp, and putting a rich Garment upon him, laid him upon a Funeral Pile. Which aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on as he had kindled, with the ſame Sword wherewith he had ſlain his Brother, he thruſt himſelf to the heart, and falling upon his Brother, was burnt in the ſame flames. He might have liv'd Innocent, had he pleaded Ignorance; but he rather choſe to make uſe of his own Piety, than the pardon of others; and for that reaſon to accompany his Brother in Death.</p>

                  <p>WE have ſeen Piety to private Relations, we are now to ſhew it toward our Native Countrey; to whoſe Majeſty paternal Authority, almoſt equal to that of the Gods, has ever ſubmitted, and to which Brotherly Affection willingly yields, and with a great deal of reaſon too. For a Family may be ruin'd, and yet the Commonwealth be ſafe; but the ruine of the Commonwealth neceſſarily draws with it the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of every Family. But how can we expreſs in words, what ſo many have teſtified at the expence of their own Lives?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Brutus</hi> the firſt Conſul meeting <hi>Aruns</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> whom he had expell'd from his Kingdom, in the field ran at him with that fury, that running each other in the body with their Spears, they fell both dead at the ſame time. I may very well
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41263:126"/>adde, that the <hi>Roman</hi> People paid dear for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when the Earth ſuddenly ſunk in the midſt of the <hi>Forum,</hi> leaving a wide hole; and that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had return'd for anſwer, that nothing could fill up that concavity, but that which the <hi>Roman</hi> People moſt valued; <hi>Gurtius</hi> a young Gentleman, noble in Birth and Minde, underſtanding that our City did excel in Vertue and Warlike Proweſs, putting on all his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ornaments, and getting up a Horſeback, he put ſpurs to his Horſe, and rid full ſpeed into the diſmal Precipice, upon whom the Citizens in his honour caſt Fruit and Grain, and then the Earth miraculouſly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again. Many wonderful things did afterwards adorn the <hi>Forum.</hi> Yet never did any one come near the Piety of <hi>Gurtius</hi> to his Countrey: For which, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the chief place of Honour, I will adde another ſomewhat like it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Genucius Cipus</hi> being Pretor, and juſt coming out of the City in his Habit of General, there befel him a moſt unheard-of Prodigy. For of a ſuddain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtarted out of his Forehead like Horns: and a Vice anſwer'd, that he ſhould be a King, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the City again. Which leſt it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he condemn'd himſelf to perpetual Baniſhment. A noble act of Piety, which conſidering the honour it deſerves, is to be preferr'd before ſeven Kings. In teſtimony whereof, a brazen Image of his Head was ſet up upon the Gate out of which he went.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Genucius</hi> bequeath'd the inheritance of his praiſe, than which a greater could not be given, to <hi>Aelius</hi> the Pretor. For when a Crow came and ſate upon his Head, as he was ſitting in Judgment, the Soothſayers affirm'd, that if he preſerv'd the Crow, his Family ſhould flouriſh, but the condition of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be moſt miſerable; but the Crow being ſlain, the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> glory. But theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <hi>Sylla, Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> laugh'd at as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Decius,</hi> who firſt brought the Conſulſhip into his own Family, ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> ready to fly and almoſt overthrown in the <hi>Latin</hi> War, vowed his own Life for the ſafety of the Army, and preſently, putting Spurs to his Horſe, he flew into the midſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſeeking his own Death and the Safety of the Commonwealth: and having made a great ſlaughter, at length orewhelm'd with the multitude of Piles and Darts, the Victime fell. And from his Blood and Wounds ſprang an unlookt for Victory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There might have been but one example of ſuch a General, had he not begot a Son anſwerable to him in courage. For he in his fourth Conſulſhip, with the ſame devotion and ſtoutneſs in fight; with the ſame event of fortune, ſuſtain'd the weak and ſinking force of our City. And therefore it was a difficult thing to underſtand, whether it were more profitable for the <hi>Roman</hi> City to have the <hi>Decii</hi> Commanders, or to looſe them: For living, they kept her from being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, but by their death it overcame.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Elder <hi>Scipio</hi> did not looſe his Life for the Commonwealth, but he carefully provided againſt the deſtruction of the Commonwealth. For when our City, after the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> expected nothing elſe but to be the Victor <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s prey; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by advice of <hi>L. Metellus,</hi> the reliques of the broken Army were conſulting to forſake <hi>Italy:</hi> He being a young Tribune, and drawing his Sword, threatned death to every man that would not take an Oath never
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41263:127"/>to forſake his Countrey: And not only ſhew'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Piety himſelf, but recall'd it back, when it was juſt forſaking the breaſts of others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To come from particulars to generals; How was the City equally divided in their flames, and equally inflamed with the Love of their Countrey! For the Treaſury being emptied in the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War, that there was not enough for the performance of their divine Ceremonies; the Publicans going to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, promiſed to let out their Money, in the ſame abundance, as if Money had abounded in the City, and not require a Farthing profit till the War was ended. The Maſters alſo of the Slaves whom <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius Gracchus</hi> had made free, for fighting ſo ſtoutly at <hi>Beneventum,</hi> forbore to ask any Money for their Service. In the Camp it ſelf there was not a Knight, not a Centurion that deſir'd any Pay. The Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo brought what Gold and Silver they had, nay the Children alſo brought their Purple Coats and Golden Hearts, that hung about their Necks, which were the enſignes of their Ingenuities. Nor would any one take advantage of the benefit of the Senates Decree, whereby ſuch and ſuch were freed from Taxes. For they were not ignorant, when <hi>Veia</hi> was taken, when the Gold which <hi>Camillus</hi> had vowed as the Tenth of their Spoil ſhould have been ſent to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> but could not be purchaſed, that the Matrons brought in all their Golden Ornaments into the Capitol. They had alſo heard, that the Thouſand Pound of Gold, which was to be paid to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> when they beſieged the Capitol, was made up by their Liberality. And therefore out of their own Goodneſs, and admoniſhed by the Example of Antiquity, they thought they were not to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>

The God returned for anſwer, that it would be ended when he fell by his Enemies hand. Which was not only ſpread about among his own People, but in the Camp of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: who thereupon commanded that not a man ſhould touch the body of <hi>Codrus.</hi> Which when the King underſtood, he threw off his Royal Robes, and in a ſervile Habit threw himſelf into the midſt of a Squadron of the Enemy, that were out a forraging, and wounding one of them with a ſcythe, provoked the ſouldier to kill him; by whoſe Death <hi>Athens</hi> eſcaped ruine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the ſame Fountain of Piety flowed the ſoul of <hi>Thraſybulus.</hi> For he being deſirous to free his Countrey from the oppreſſion of the Thirty Tyrants, and was going about the enterprize with a ſmall number of Men, one of his Company ſaid to him; How much will <hi>Athens</hi> be indebted to thee, if they regain their Liberty by thy means? <hi>The Gods grant,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>that I may have then paid them what I owe them.</hi> With which Wiſh he heap'd a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon his renowned work of deſtroying the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> whoſe Vertue made him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, his Countries injury the General of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that he might not be forced to invade it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtituted a ſacrifice, he drank up a full Beaker
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41263:128"/>of Bulls Blood, and fell before the Altar a renowned Victime of Piety.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There follows an Example of the ſame nature. When <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> contended moſt obſtinately for a ſpot of ground; at length it was agreed to ſend certain Young-men from ſuch a diſtance, and where ever they met, that place to be the bound of both their Territories. But in this Agreement two <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Brothers, call'd <hi>Philaeni,</hi> were too hard for the other, ſetting out ſooner and making more haſte: which when the Young-men of <hi>Cyrene</hi> underſtood, they for a long time complain'd of their fallacy; but at length they reſolv'd to recompence the injury by propoſing a ſevere condition. For they propoſed to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that that place ſhould be the bounds agreed upon, provided the <hi>Philaeni</hi> would ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be buried there. But the event diſappointed their expectation; for they without any delay deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their bodies to be buried. Who, becauſe they rather deſired large bounds to their Countrey, than large limits of Life, lye entombed in honour, the <hi>Punic</hi> Empire being extended by the reſignation of their bones. Where are now the proud Walls of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage?</hi> Where is the Maritime Glory of that Port? Where is their Navy, ſo terrible upon every ſhore? Where are all their Armies? Where their numerous Squadrons of Horſe? Where thoſe Souls that were not ſatisfied with the vaſt tract of <hi>Africa?</hi> All theſe things Fortune divided between two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. But the deſtruction of their Countrey did not aboliſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that noble Act perform'd by the <hi>Philaeni.</hi> So that mortal courage or ſtrength can purchaſe nothing immortal, but Vertue alone.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Piety was inflamed with youthful Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41263:129"/>for the ſafety of his Countrey, that he ſnatch'd it out of the hands of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> almoſt levell'd with the ground and in their poſſeſſion, as he lay in his little Bed in <hi>Athens.</hi> So that <hi>Stagira</hi> was no leſs famous for being ſubverted by <hi>Alexander,</hi> as for being reſtor'd by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Hence it is apparent, how kinde, nay how profuſe in their piety in their Countrey, all ages, all degrees of men have been: And how the truth of wonderful Examples, evident to the world, hath ſubſcribed to the Laws of Nature.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41263:129"/>proper for the eaſe of a Bed, than the labour of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats. He alſo followed the Triumphers Chariot, whom he had formerly carried in his own: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not the Companion, but the Author of the Triumph.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Caeſetius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights ſate was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo glorious, yet his Indulgence to his Son was no leſs; who being commanded by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> now Victor over all his forreign and domeſtick Enemies, to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit and abjure his Son, becauſe that he being Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the People had accuſed <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the People of affecting the Empire, ventur'd to give him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Thou ſhalt rather take from me, O</hi> Caeſar, <hi>all my Sons, thou compel me to diſinherit this one, by my own act.</hi> But he had two ſons beſides, that were hopeful Yong-men, to whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had largely promiſed great Preferment.

But let us come to things more pleaſant to the ear. <hi>Antiochus</hi> the ſon of King <hi>Seleucus,</hi> diſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with his Mother-in-law <hi>Stratonice,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with what unlawful flames he burnt, cover'd the impious wound of his breaſt with a pious diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Thereupon different Affections being inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſame Marrow and Bowels, unlimited Deſires and exceſſive Modeſty had conſumed his Body to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He kept his bed, like one ready to expire. His Relations mourn'd; the Father was overwhelm'd with ſadneſs, lamenting the loſs of his only ſon, and the want of ſucceſſion, and the face of the whole Court was rather Funeſt, than Royal. But this cloud of ſadneſs was ſoon diſpell'd by the foreſight of <hi>Lepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Mathematician, or as others ſay, of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> the Phyſician; who ſitting upon <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Bed-ſide, obſerving him to bluſh when <hi>Stratonice</hi> entered the Chamber, and that his Pulſes beat with more life; but that he waxed pale, and fetch'd deep ſighs, when ſhe departed again: At length found out the truth, and declared it to <hi>Seleucus.</hi> Who without any more ado parted with his deareſt Wife to his ſon: attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting his Love to Chance, but the concealing it to death to his Modeſty. Let us now conſider <hi>Seleucus</hi> as a King, an Old Man, and a Lover, and then it will appear how many and how difficult obſtacles did Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Indulgence overcome.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Seleucus</hi> parted only with his Wife, but <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes</hi> parted with the Kingdom of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to his ſon in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s preſence: whoſe Tribunal when he aſcended, and by him invited ſate down alſo in the Running-C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Young-man wept, his Body trembled, the Diadem fell out of his hand, nor could he go any further: And, which was almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, he that parted with a Kingdom was glad; he that was to accept it, ſad and ſorrowful. Nor had that famous conteſt had an end, had not <hi>Pompey</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Authority; For he called the Prince King, commanded him to take the Diadem, and conſtrained him to ſit down by him in the Running-Chair.</p>

                  <p>HAving made a relation of ſuch Parents as patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brooked the Injuries of their Children, let us ſpeak of ſuch as have born their Death couragiouſly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Horatius Pulvillus</hi> being to dedicate a Temple in the Capitol of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as he was holding the poſt, and ready to pronounce certain ſolemn words, news was brought him that his Son was dead: But he neither took his hand off the poſt, nor made the leaſt interruption in the Dedication of the Temple, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his countenance from the publick Ceremony to his private Grief; leſt he might ſeem rather to have acted the part of a Father, than a High-prieſt. <hi>Bury the carcaſs then,</hi> ſaid he.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. A great Example, and no leſs renowned than the former, is that which follows. <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> the pattern of a moſt happy, yet a moſt unfortunate Father, of four Sons which he had, all hopeful and beautiful youths, had tranſlated two into the <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Family by right of Adoption, and only reſerved two to himſelf. One of which died four daies before his Fathers Triumph. The other alive in the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Chariot expir'd the third day after. Thus he that was ſo liberal in beſtowing Children upon others, was himſelf left childleſs in a ſhort time. Which Misfortune, that you may know how magnanimouſly he brook'd it, he made plainly apparent in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made to the People, concerning the Actions which he had done for them, by adding this little clauſe: <hi>When in the higheſt ſucceſs of my felicity, I was afraid, moſt noble</hi> Romans, <hi>that Fortune would do me ſome miſchief or other; I prayed to</hi> Jupiter, Juno <hi>and</hi> Minerva, <hi>that if any thing of Calamity threatned the</hi> Roman <hi>Government, they would exhauſt it all upon my Family. And therefore 'tis very well; for according to my wiſhes, they have ſo ordered it, that you ſhould rather compaſſionate my private, than I bewail your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick loſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will only adde one Domeſtic Example more, and then permit my Story to wander. <hi>Q. Marcius Rex</hi> the Elder, Colleague with <hi>Cato</hi> in the Conſulſhip, loſt a Son of eminent hopes and piety, and which added to his calamity, his onely Child. Yet when he ſaw his Family ruin'd and ended by his death, he ſo ſuppreſs'd his grief by the depth of his prudence, that immediately he went from his Sons grave to the Senate-houſe; and as it was his duty that day, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſummon'd all the Senators together. So that had he not generouſly ſuſtain'd his ſorrow, he could not have equally divided the light of one day between
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41263:134"/>a ſad and mournful Father, and a ſtout Conſul; not having omitted the good offices of either.</p>

Another perſon would have remov'd the Sacrifice, would have thrown away the Ornaments of the Altars, and caſt away the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe all bedabl'd with tears. But <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s body ſtood immoveable to Religion, and, his minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd fix'd in the advice of prudence.

                  <p>WHence ſhall I ſummon thee forth, fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, the chief ſupport of Men and Women! For thou inhabiteſt the Hearths conſecrated to <hi>Veſta,</hi> by the antient Religion. Thou broodeſt upon the Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Jupiter Capitoline.</hi> Thou the pillar of the <hi>Palatium,</hi> rendereſt famous the moſt illuſtrious Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Gods, and the moſt ſacred Genial Bed of <hi>Julia,</hi> by thy fixed habitation there. Thy Guardianſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the honour of young Youth. And out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thy Deity, riper age continues incontaminate. Under thy protection the Matrons Stole, or long
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41263:135"/>Garment is reverenc'd. Come hither then, and know what thou thy ſelf wouldſt have others do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Lucretia</hi> the firſt Example of <hi>Roman</hi> Chaſtity, whoſe manlike Soul was, by the miſtake of Fortune, encloſed in a female Body, being conſtrain'd to ſuffer herſelf to be raviſh'd by <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> the ſon of him firnamed the <hi>Proud;</hi> when ſhe had before an aſſembly of her Kindred and Friends lamented in moſt paſſionate expreſſions the Injury which ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſtabb'd herſelf with a Dagger, which ſhe had conceal'd under her Garment. Whoſe magnanimous Death gave the people an occaſion to alter the Kingly Government into Conſular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither would <hi>Virginius</hi> brook an injury of this nature, though a perſon of a very Vulgar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, but of a Patrician ſpirit; for leſt his Family ſhould be diſhonour'd, he ſpared not his own fleſh and blood. For when <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir, confiding in his power, violently proſecuted the defiling of his Daughter, he brought her forth publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Market-place and ſlew her: chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Murtherer of a chaſt, than the Father of a contaminated Daughter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor was <hi>Pontius Aufidianus</hi> endued with leſs Courage of Minde, being a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, who finding the Virginity of his Daughter proſtituted by a Pedagogue to <hi>Fannius Saturninus;</hi> not content to have put the wicked Servant to death, he kill'd his Daughter. And that ſhe might not celebrate diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Nuptials, he married her to a bitter Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Pub. Maenius?</hi> What a ſtrict Guardian of Chaſtity was he! For he puniſhed a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, for whom he had a great kindneſs, only becauſe he had kiſs'd his Daughter, being of womans eſtate; though it might ſeem not to have bin done ſo
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41263:136"/>much out of Luſt, as by a miſtake of breeding, or long acquaintance. But he thought fit to imprint the Diſcipline of Chaſtity into the apprehenſion of the tender Maid, by the ſeverity of his ſervants puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and taught her by ſo ſevere an Example, that ſhe was not only to preſerve her Virginity, but her Lips uncontaminated for her Husband.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus,</hi> after he had born many great Offices with renown, coming to the Cenſorſhip, queſtion'd his only Son for the doubtful loſs of his Chaſtity: and he underwent the puniſhment, by baniſhing himſelf out of the reach of his Father.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſhould have ſaid the Cenſor had been too rigid, but that <hi>P. Attilius Philiſcus,</hi> who ſuffered his body to be made uſe of by his Maſter for gain, prov'd ſo ſevere a Father afterwards: For he ſlew his Daughter, becauſe ſhe play'd the whore. How ſacred then ought we to think Chaſtity was, in our City, where the Procurers of Luſt, did ſo cruelly chaſtiſe it?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Example of a moſt excellent perſon and a memorable act follows. <hi>M. Claudius Marcellus,</hi> one of the Aedils that rode in the moving Chair of State, accus'd <hi>Scantinius</hi> a Tribune, and ſummon'd him to anſwer before the People; becauſe he had given out, that his Son had been abus'd in his Body. But he averring that he could not be compell'd to appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was priviledg'd, and calling the Tribunal power to his aſſiſtance; the whole Colledge of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes denied to intercede in a cauſe where Chaſtity was call'd in queſtion. <hi>Scantinius</hi> therefore being cited, was condemn'd by that very witneſs, who was accus'd by himſelf. For it is ſaid, that the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being produc'd before the Judgment-ſeat, with his eyes fixed upon the ground, obſerv'd a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſilence by which modeſt ſilence he moſt of all prevail'd in his revenge.</p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:41263:136"/>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Metellus Celer</hi> alſo was a moſt ſevere chaſtiſer of Libidinous Intent; ſummoning <hi>Cn. Sergius Silus</hi> to anſwer before the People, for only proffering a ſum of Money to the Miſtriſs of the Family, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for that ſingle Crime. For then not the deed alone, but the very intention was brought into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and it was more harm, to have willed an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, than it was profitable not to offend.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus far the Juridical Gravity: here follows the extrajudicial. <hi>T. Veturius,</hi> ſon of that <hi>Veturius,</hi> who was delivered bound to the <hi>Samnites</hi> for making a diſhonourable Truce with them, when by reaſon of the ruine of his Eſtate, and the great Debts of his family, he was forc'd to yield himſelf in his youth bound to <hi>Plotius,</hi> and was by him ſeverely whipp'd, becauſe he would not permit him to make uſe of his Body, complain'd thereof to the Conſuls: Who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Senate with the matter, ſent <hi>Plotius</hi> to priſon. For they endeavour'd to preſerve the Chaſtity of the <hi>Roman</hi> blood ſafe, in what ſtate or condition ſoever.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And what wonder if all the Conſcript-Fathers made this decree? <hi>C. Peſcennius,</hi> in Capital matters Triumvir, loaded with the publick chains <hi>Cornelius</hi> a moſt noted ſouldier, and one that had been four times advanc'd to be a Centurion of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> or old Souldiers; becauſe he had had private familiarity with a Youth born of free Parents. From whence appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tribunes, when he ſpoke nothing of the Fact, but only ſaid, <hi>That he was ready to put in ball, and to make it out, that the Boy bad made a publick proſtitution of his body for Money;</hi> they abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take any cognizance of the matter. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Cornelius</hi> died in priſon. For the Tribunes thought it too mean a thing for our Commonwealth to make bargains with men, how ſtout ſoever, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41263:137"/>to ſell Domeſtick pleaſure at the price of Forraign danger.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. After the puniſhment of a luſtful Centurion, the ſevere uſage of <hi>Mar. Laetorius Mergus,</hi> a Military Tribune, and his ignominious Death, is next to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: who was cited before the People by <hi>Cominius,</hi> one of their Tribunes, being accus'd by his Muſter-maſter for a force upon his body. Nor would <hi>Laeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> abide the Tryal; but firſt of all privately fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judgement, and then ſlew himſelf. Yet though he had ſatisfied Natures debt by his Death, yet was he by the People condemn'd for the crime of Unchaſtity; the ſevere Diſcipline of the Camp, which was the moſt certain Guardian of the conſecrated Eagle, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, proſecuting him even to his Tomb. Becauſe he had committed a force upon the body of him, whoſe Maſter and Commander he was.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This mov'd <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> then when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>C. Luſcius</hi> his Siſters ſon, and a Tribune of the People, to be legally ſlain by <hi>C. Plotius</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier; becauſe he durſt impeach him before the people, upon an accuſation of abuſing his Body.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But to give a ſlight account of thoſe, who have made uſe of their own inſtead of the publick Law, in the vindication of their Chaſtity: <hi>Sempronius Muſca</hi> caus'd <hi>C. Gallius</hi> to be whipp'd, for being taken in the act. <hi>C. Memmius</hi> alſo caus'd <hi>L. Octavius</hi> to be handled after the ſame manner for the ſame fact: <hi>Carbo Accienus</hi> was gelt by <hi>Vibienus, Pontius</hi> by <hi>P. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> being both taken in the Act. A certain perſon alſo took <hi>Cn. Furius Brochus</hi> in the fact, and deliver'd him over to be abus'd by the whole Family: who counted it no detriment to indulge their own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. And that I may adde Forraign to Domeſtick Examples, a <hi>Grecian</hi> woman named <hi>Hippo,</hi> bring ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Enemies Fleet, flung herſelf into the Sea, that ſhe might preſerve her Chaſtity: whoſe body waſting to the <hi>Erechtean</hi> ſhore, was buried by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and lies cover'd with a little hillock to this day. But <hi>Greece</hi> having committed to eternal memory the honour of her Sanctity, makes her every day more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A more vehement this, that which follows a more conſiderate Example of Chaſtity. The Army of the <hi>Gallo-Graeci</hi> being all defeated and taken by <hi>Cn. Manlius,</hi> upon the Mountain <hi>Olympus,</hi> the wife of <hi>Orgiagon,</hi> a woman of extraordinary Beauty, was taken likewiſe and forc'd by the Centurion, to whoſe cuſtody ſhe was committed. When ſhe came to that place, where by the Conſuls command the Centurion had ſent to the friends of the Woman to bring her Ranſome, while the Centurion was weighing the Gold, with his eyes fix'd upon the quantity, the <hi>Gallo-Grecian</hi> in her own language commanded thoſe of her own Nation to kill him; and then with the Head cut off in her hand, ſhe went to her Husband, and caſting it at her feet, ſhe related the injury done her, and her own revenge. What part of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can any one ſay was in the power of the Enemy, but her Body? for neither could her Minde be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, nor her Chaſtity taken.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the Wives of the <hi>Teutons</hi> beſought <hi>Marius</hi> their Conquerour, that they might be ſent by him as a Preſent to the Veſtal Virgins, affirming that they would abſtain from the company of men as ſacredly as they ſhould. But that requeſt not being granted
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41263:138"/>them, the next night they all hang'd themſelves. 'Twas well the Gods did not infuſe the ſame Courage into their Husbands in the field.

                  <p>AS I did not invite Liberty, atteſted as well by the Words as by the Sayings of vehement Spirits; ſo I will not exclude it coming in my way. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcituated between Vertue and Vice, if it keep it ſelf within the bounds of Moderation, may deſerve Praiſe; if it launch out further than the limits of due reſpect, is to be reprehended: becoming thereby more grateful to the ears of the Vulgar, than approv'd by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41263:138"/>Wiſemen; and is more ſecure in the pardon of others, than in the providence of the perſon. But ſince we have reſolv'd to proſecute all the parts of Humane Action; let us relate the Story upon our own credit, and let others judge as they think fit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Privernum</hi> being taken, and thoſe perſons put to death, who had caus'd the Town to rebel; the Senate mov'd with indignation, conſider'd what they ſhould do with the reſt of the Inhabitants. Thus their ſafety was in a fluctuating condition, at the ſame time ſubject to the Victors, and thoſe that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd againſt them. But when they ſaw there was no way but to ſubmit and petition, they could not forget that they had ſome <hi>Italian</hi> blood in their Veins. For the chief in Court being examin'd among them, what puniſhment they deſerv'd; made anſwer, What pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they deſerv'd, who thought themſelves worthy of Liberty. He had taken Arms in words, and had inflam'd the incens'd minds of the Senators. When <hi>Plautius</hi> the Conſul favouring the cauſe of the <hi>Privernates,</hi> put a ſtop to his ſtout anſwer, and ask'd him again, What kind of Peace the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould make with them, granting them their pardon? But he with a reſolute Countenance return'd again, <hi>If ye grant us good Conditions, let the Peace be perpetual; if bad, as ſhort as you pleaſe.</hi> By which ſtern Repartie he brought it to paſs, that the vanquiſh'd were not only pardon'd, but enjoy'd the Priviledges of our City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus the Captain of the <hi>Privernates</hi> ſpoke in the Senate. But <hi>L. Philippus</hi> the Couſul did not forbear to make uſe of the ſame liberty againſt the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For upbraiding their ſloath before the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> he told them, <hi>The Commonwealth ſtood in need of another Senate;</hi> and was ſo far from repenting for what he had ſaid, that he commanded <hi>L. Craſſus,</hi> a man of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41263:139"/>great Dignity and Eloquence, to be laid hold on for murmuring againſt it. But he, thruſting back the Lictor, <hi>Thou art no Conſul of mine,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>becauſe I am no Senator of thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What! Were the people ſafe from the aſſaults of Liberty? No, it both aſſail'd them, and found them patiently ſuffering. <hi>Carbo</hi> a Tribune of the People, and a moſt turbulent aſſertor of the <hi>Gracchian</hi> Sedition, and a moſt abſolure firebrand of the growing Civil Wars, having hal'd <hi>P. Africanus</hi> from the very Gate of the City to the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> as he return'd with Triumph from the ruines of <hi>Numantium,</hi> there ask'd him his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the death of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> whoſe Siſter he had married: that by the authority of a perſon ſo much in credit, he might adde fuel to the fire already begun: Not doubting, but that in regard of their near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would have ſpoken ſomewhat affectionately in behalf of his Brother that was put to death; but he anſwer'd, <hi>That he was legally ſlain.</hi> Upon which ſaying, when the whole Aſſembly incens'd with the Tribunitian fury, began to make a great Clamour, <hi>Hold your peace,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you, to whom</hi> Italy <hi>is but a ſtepmother.</hi> And when they began to ſet up another Cry, <hi>You ſhall never make me fear,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thoſe free, whom I brought hither bound.</hi> Thus were the whole People reproved by one man with contempt. What an honour they gave to Vertue! They preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were mute. The <hi>Numantine</hi> Victory freſh in Memory, his Fathers <hi>Macedonian</hi> Conqueſt, his Grand-fathers <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Trophies, and the Necks of two Kings, <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Syphax,</hi> chain'd to their Triumphal Chariots, ſtopt the mouths of the enraged Multitude. Nor did ſilence proceed from fear, but becauſe through the aid of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> and <hi>Aemilian</hi> Families, many fears of the City and <hi>Italy</hi> were put to an end; the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were not free, in reſpect of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Liberty.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:41263:139"/>
                  <p n="4">4. And therefore we need the leſs wonder that the vaſt Authority of <hi>Pompey</hi> conteſted ſo often with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Nor was it without great applauſe that he took things patiently, becauſe it was his fortune to be a laughing-ſtock to the licenſe of all ſorts of men. <hi>Cn. Piſo</hi> when he had indited <hi>Manilius Criſpus,</hi> and ſaw him, though apparently guilty, to be protected by <hi>Pompey;</hi> being carried on with a youthful heat and deſire of accuſation, he tax'd the potent defendour with many great and hainous Crimes: Being then examin'd by him, why he did not accuſe him himſelf ? <hi>Do but thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>give Sureties to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if thou art accuſed, that thou wilt not raiſe a Civil War, and I will cauſe the Judges to ſit upon thy head, before they ſit upon the head of</hi> Munilius. Thus by the ſame Judgment he maintain'd two perſons guilty; <hi>Manilius</hi> by his Accuſation, <hi>Pompey</hi> by his Liberty: and the one he fulfill'd by Law, the other by the profeſſion of his good will, not being able to go any farther.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What therefore is Liberty without <hi>Cato?</hi> No more than <hi>Cato</hi> without Liberty. For when he ſate Judge upon a Senator, that was very guilty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, and that there were Certificates produced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pompey</hi>'s hand, in favour of the party accus'd, he preſently caus'd them to be laid aſide, reciting the Law, wherein it was enacted that no Senator ſhould make uſe of any ſuch aſſiſtance. The fact is not much to be wonder'd at, conſidering the perſon; for what might ſeem ſaucineſs in another, was in <hi>Cato</hi> known to be Fidelity to his Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Cn. Lentulus Marcellinus</hi> the Conſul, when he was complaining in a ſet Speech of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s prodigious power, and that all the people began to cry him up; <hi>Shout,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhout while you may, brave</hi> Romans, <hi>ſhortly it will not be lawful for you to do it, and go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd.</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:41263:140"/>Thus was the power of a potent Citizen nipp'd, on the one ſide by an envious complaint, on the other ſide by a ſad lamentation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To which eminent Citizen, having his thigh bound about with a white Shaſh, <hi>It matters not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Favonius, upon what part of the body the Diadem be worn.</hi> Upbraiding his Kingly Power, by cavilling at a tittle piece of cloth. But he turning his head neither one way nor other, was mighty careful how he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his power by any chearfulneſs in his looks, or how he ſhewed his Anger by any Severity: and by that patience laid himſelf open to the meaneſt and loweſt fort of people.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Helvius Mancia Formianus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> when he was very old accus'd <hi>Libo</hi> to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: In which conteſt when <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him with his low condition, and his old age, and told him withal, that he was ſent from the Grave to be an Accuſer; <hi>Thou telleſt no untruth,</hi> Pompey, ſaid he, <hi>I come from the infernal ſhades to accuſe</hi> Libo. <hi>But when I was there, I ſaw</hi> Cn. Domitius Ahenobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus <hi>all bloody and weeping; for that being of a noble Extraction, of an upright Life and Converſation, and a great Lover of his Countrey, he was put to death in the flower of his youth at thy command. I ſaw there alſo</hi> Brutus, <hi>famous in the ſame degree, hack'd and hew'd, complaining that the ſame calamity befel him, firſt through thy perfidy, and then by thy cruelty. I ſaw</hi> Cn. Carbo <hi>a zealous defender of thy youth and of thy paternal eſtate, in his third Conſulſhip, laden with thoſe chains which thou didſt cauſe to be put upon him; and upbraiding thee, that contrary to all equity and juſtice, he was ſlain by thee a private</hi> Roman <hi>Knight, when he was the greateſt Officer in the Commonwealth. I ſaw in the ſame habit and condition, a perſon of the Pretorian Order,</hi> Perpenna, <hi>curſing thy Cruelty; and all with one
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41263:140"/>conſent bewailing their hard fate, that they ſhould fall uncondemn'd, under ſuch a young hangman as thou.</hi> It was lawful for a Member of a Municipal Town, that ſtill had a twang of his Fathers ſervitude, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled raſhneſs and an unſufferable malice to recal to minde the wide wounds which he had receiv'd in the Civil War, now grown dry with age. And therefore at that time he was in the ſtrongeſt condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <hi>Pompey,</hi> as well as in the ſafeſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Diphilus</hi> the Tragedian, when in the <hi>Apollinary</hi> Plays he came to that Verſe, wherein there is this Sentence, <hi>Our miſery is, Magnus;</hi> he pronounced the words pointing full upon <hi>Pompey:</hi> And being rebuk'd by the People, immediately fell to act him, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that carried himſelf too great and buſie in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. With the ſame petulancy he repeated thoſe other words, <hi>The time ſhall come when thou ſhalt bewail that vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The mind of <hi>Marcus Caſtricius</hi> was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with Liberty, who being the chief Magiſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="11">11. But the Accuſation of <hi>Ser. Galba</hi> was ſtrangely preſumptuous. Who forbore not to tax the ſacred <hi>Julius</hi> himſelf after all his Victories, as he ſate in the Seat of Judicature. Caius Julius Caeſar, ſaid he, <hi>I took up money upon my bail for</hi> Pompey <hi>the Great, thy Son-in-Law, in his third Conſulſhip:What ſhall I do? Muſt I ſuffer?</hi> He deſerv'd to have been turn'd out of

                  <p n="12">12. <hi>A. Caeſellius</hi> a famous Civilian, yet how ſawcie and impertinent!

                     <p n="2">2. The next now is not only a ſtout, but a lepid and witty liberty of ſpeech.

Then <hi>Truely Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the reaſon of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is very well grounded: For when I was a Girl, and that a very ſevere Tyrant ruled over us, I deſired his death; he being ſlain, one more cruel came in his place: then I prayed that he might be taken out of the way; after whom, we began to feel thee worſe than all the reſt: And therefore fearing leſt if thou ſhouldſt die, a worſe than thee ſhould ſucceed, I pray to the Gods for thy ſafety.</hi> Which facetious boldneſs, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> himſelf had not the face to puniſh.</p>

For the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> not contented with putting him to Death, pull'd his Houſe down over him when he was dead, that he might be puniſh'd alſo with the deſtruction of his Houſhold-Gods. Upon the Ground they built a Temple to <hi>Tellus.</hi> Thus the Habitation of a powerful
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41263:142"/>man, is now the Monument of Religious Severity. The ſame end had <hi>Sp. Maelius</hi> by the Sentence of his Countrey, for the ſame crime.</p>
                  <p>So that we finde how great an antipathy the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients had againſt the Enemies of their Liberty, by the very Ruines and Walls of their Houſes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſes of <hi>M. Flaccus</hi> and <hi>L. Saturnius,</hi> moſt ſeditious Citizens, were pull'd to the ground after they were ſlain. At length <hi>Flaccus</hi>'s ground, after it had long remain'd unbuilt, was adorn'd by <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> with the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> ſpoils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> were eminent in our City for their Nobility, and the hope which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them: But becauſe they endeavour'd the ſubverſion of the Commonwealth, their Bodies lay unburied, and the laſt Offices due to Mortality were wanting to the Sons of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phews of <hi>Africanus.</hi> Their familiar acquaintance alſo, leſt there ſhould be any Friends of the Commonwealths Enemies left, were ſhut up in a hollow Oak, and tumbled headlong to the bottom of that place in the Priſon, which was therefore call'd <hi>Robur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame thing did <hi>P. Mucius</hi> a Tribune of the People think lawful for him to do, as the People and the Senate had done before; who burnt all his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues alive; becauſe, being ſet on by <hi>Sp. Caſſius,</hi> they ſtrove to hinder the Election of Magiſtrates, to the publick hazard of the common Liberty. Never was any thing more confidently acted than this Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For he, a ſingle Tribune, durſt inflict that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon nine of his Colleagues, which nine Tribunes durſt not exact from one Tribune.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Severity hitherto, a moſt rigid Guardian and Aſſertor of Liberty, was equally as truculent alſo in the preſervation of Diſcipline and Dignity. For the Senate ſent <hi>M. Clodius</hi> to the <hi>Corſi,</hi> becauſe he had
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41263:143"/>concluded an ignominious Peace with them: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not receive him, caus'd him to be put to Death in Priſon. When once the Majeſty of the Empire was broken, how many ways did obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Anger vindicate it! They nullified the Accord, they deprived him of his Liberty and Life, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd his Carcaſs with the ignominious contumely of the Priſon, and the <hi>Gemonian</hi> Precipice. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had deſerv'd this extraordinary chaſtiſement of the Senate. But <hi>Cn. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hiſpallus,</hi> had the experience of it, before he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. For the Province of <hi>Spain</hi> falling to him by lot, they made a Decree, that he ſhould not go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a reaſon added, Becauſe he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf as he ought to do. And therefore the Queſtor <hi>Cornelius</hi> had very like to have ſuffer'd upon the Law of Bribery, for living in diſhonour without any Provincial imployment. Neither was the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Senate leſs to <hi>C. Vettienus,</hi> who cut off the Fingers of his left hand, becauſe he would not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>Italian</hi> War. For they confiſcated his eſtate, and impriſoned him as long as he lived; cauſing him to ſpend his days and waſte that life ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in a Jail, which he refuſed nobly to venture in the Field.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Example <hi>Curius</hi> the Conſul imitating, who being forced to proclaim a ſuddain liſting of Souldiers, when none of the Youngmen appeared, having cauſed Lots to be made for all the Tribes, he commanded the firſt Name that was drawn to be cited: And becauſe he did not anſwer to his Name, he made a publick Sale of the Youngmans goods. Which aſſoon as the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had notice of, he ran to the Conſul's Tribunal, and appeal'd to the Colledge of Tribunes: But there <hi>Curius</hi> making a Speech, and declaring that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had no need of a Citizen that knew not how
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41263:143"/>to obey; and ſo ſold both his Goods and the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man too.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the ſame manner did <hi>L. Domitius</hi> ſtand to his panpudding. For when he was Propraetor in <hi>Sicily,</hi> there being a Boar of an extraordinary ſize preſented to him, he commanded the Shepherd that had killed him to be brought before him: and enquiring of him with what Weapon he had killed the beaſt; when he found he had kill'd him with a Pike-ſtaff, he cauſed him to be crucified: having publiſh'd a Proclamation before, for ſuppreſſing the Robberies that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Iſland, that no perſon ſhould carry a Dart. Some would take this to be the height of all Severity; for it may be diſputed on both ſides. But the reaſon and neceſſities of publick Government will not ſuffer the Pretor to be counted over-rigorous.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus Severity exercis'd it ſelf in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men: Not was it leſs ſedulous in the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Women. <hi>Horatius,</hi> one of thoſe that fought the three <hi>Curiatii,</hi> by the conditions of the Combat Victor over all the reſt of the <hi>Albans,</hi> when returning home from that renowned field, he found his Siſter, a Virgin, bewailing the death of one of the <hi>Curiatii,</hi> to whom ſhe was betroth'd, more tenderly than became her age, ran her through with the Sword with which he had ſo well merited of his Countrey: not thinking them chaſt Tears, which were ſhed for a fond and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Affection. For which fact being endited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People, his Father defended him. Thus the inclination of the Virgin toward the memory of her promis'd Husband, was chaſtiz'd by a fierce Brother, while the Father aſſerted and defended the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Senate afterwards following the ſame Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Severity, commanded <hi>Sp. Poſthumius Albinus</hi> and <hi>Q. Marcius Philippus,</hi> the Conſuls, to enquire
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41263:144"/>after thoſe Women who practis'd Inceſt at the Feaſt of <hi>Bacchanals:</hi> By whom when many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, their Kindred puniſh'd them all at home; and the ignominy of publick ſhame, was corrected by the ſeverity of the chaſtiſement: Whereby the more the Women had ſham'd our City by their lewd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſo much the more fame they brought to it by the Severity of their Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But <hi>Publicia</hi> who poyſon'd <hi>Poſthumius Albinus</hi> the Conſul, and <hi>Licinia</hi> who poyſon'd <hi>Claudius Aſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> their Husbands, were ſtrangled by order of their next Relations. For thoſe ſevere men did not think it neceſſary, where the crime was ſo evident and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to ſpend time in a publick Tryal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they would have defended the Innocent, they were the early puniſhers of the Guilty.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Crime of theſe was great, that excited Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſo ſharp a Revenge: but <hi>Egnatius Metellus</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Severity for a far more inconſiderable matter, who beat his Wife to death for drinking Wine. For which fact he was ſo far from being accus'd, that he was not ſo much as reprehended: every one believing, that for good examples ſake, ſhe had undergone the puniſhment of violated Sobriety very juſtly. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whatever woman covets the immoderate uſe of Wine, ſhuts the door to all Virtues, and opens it to all Vices.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Terrible alſo was the Matrimonial frown of <hi>C. Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> who divorc'd his Wife, becauſe he underſtood that ſhe went abroad with her head un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd. A rigid Sentence; and yet there was ſome reaſon for it. For the Law, ſaid he, confines thee to have no other Judges of thy Beauty but my eyes; for theſe adorn thy ſelf, be thou only fair to theſe, and do thou believe their judgment: The farther ſight of thee, where it was needleſs, muſt of neceſſity be ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and criminal.</p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:41263:144"/>
                  <p n="11">11. Nor did <hi>Qu. Antiſtius Vetus</hi> think otherwiſe, who divorc'd his Wife, becauſe he ſaw her talking in the ſtreet with a certain ordinary freed Woman: for being incens'd at the fault, he prevented the crime; and avoided the injury, that he might not revenge it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. To theſe we muſt adde <hi>P. Sempronius Sophus,</hi> who divorc'd his Wife, becauſe ſhe went to ſee a Play without making him acquainted therewith. While this care was taken of old to prevent the Crimes of Women, they were free from offending.</p>

But though the <hi>Roman</hi> Examples might ſuffice to inſtruct the whole world, yet will it not be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to know what Forraigners have done. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> caus'd the Books of <hi>Archilochus</hi> to be thrown out of their City, becauſe they thought them not modeſt and chaſt enough to be read. For they would not have the minds of their Children ſeaſon'd with thoſe things, which would be a greater miſchief to their Manners than a profit to their Ingenuities. And therefore they puniſh'd the greateſt Poet, or the next to the greateſt in the world, by exiling his Verſes, becauſe he made ſmutty Satyrs againſt <hi>Lycam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> who had injur'd him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                  <p>TEnacious Memory keeps in ſtrict remembrance the great and moſt excellent part of applauſe which thoſe things deſerve among renowned men, which were gravely ſaid or done by them. Among the plentiful Examples whereof, let us ſelect, neither with too ſparing or too liberal a hand, thoſe which may rather ſatisfie than ſatiate expectation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When our City was in a ſtrange confuſion upon the Overthrow of <hi>Cannae,</hi> when the Safety of the Commonwealth hung with a ſlender thread upon the fidelity of our Allies; That they might continue the more ſtedfaſt in the defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the greateſt part of the Senate moved, that the Princes of the <hi>Latins</hi> might be admitted among them. As <hi>Annius</hi> formerly and the <hi>Campanians</hi> averi'd, that one of the Conſuls ought to belong to <hi>Capua,</hi> and the other to <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo ſick was then the condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Then <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> of the race of him who had overthrown the <hi>Latins,</hi> near the River
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41263:145"/>
                     <hi>Veſeris</hi> in a memorable Battle, with a loud voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That if any of the Aſſociates durſt come to give his vote among the Conſcript Fathers, he would kill him with his own hand.</hi> The threats of this one ſingle perſon, both reſtor'd the priſtine heat to the languiſhing ſpirits of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and hinder'd <hi>Italy</hi> from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themſelves to equal Priviledges with our City. For as before they were broken by the Arms of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, ſo now they gave over, vanquiſh'd by this mans words.</p>
                  <p>Equal to this was the Gravity of <hi>Manlius:</hi> For when the Conſulſhip was conferr'd upon him by the conſent of all men, and that he refus'd it by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of his Eyes, yet for all that was vehemently urged to accept it; <hi>Chooſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſome other perſon upon whom to confer this Honour; for if ye compel me to take it upon me, neither ſhall I endure your Cuſtomes, neither will you endure the Severity of my Government.</hi> If the voice of a private perſon was ſo heavy, what would the Faſces of the Conſul have bin?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No leſs mean was the Gravity of <hi>Scipio Aemilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> both in the Court, and in his Aſſembly-Speeches: Who, when <hi>Mummius</hi> was his companion in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorſhip, though noble, yet effeminate and weak, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in a publick Speech before the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> that he would have acted for the Majeſty of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whether his Citizens had given him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion or not.</p>
                  <p>The ſame perſon, when <hi>Ser. Sulpicius Galba</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Cotta,</hi> Conſuls, contended in the Senate whether of the two ſhould be ſent againſt <hi>Viriatus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that there hapned to be a great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the Fathers, while they all expected him to declare his opinion; <hi>I think it not fit that either of them ſhould be ſent,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in regard the one has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the other never knows when he has enough.</hi>

But <hi>Popilius</hi> incens'd at his delay, <hi>Before thou goeſt out of this circle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>give me the anſwer which I ſhall return to the Senate.</hi> You would not have thought him an Embaſſadour that ſpoke, but the whole body of the Senate: For immediately the King affirm'd, that he would give no farther occaſion for <hi>Ptolomie</hi> to complain. And then at length <hi>Popilius</hi> took him by the hand as an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. Behold the force of a conciſe and efficacious Gravity of Mind and Speech! At the ſame time it terrified the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> and protected <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But I cannot tell whether I ſhould firſt conſider the Words or Deeds of <hi>P. Rutilius,</hi> for there lies an admirable ſtreſs in both. When he withſtood the urgent requeſt of a certain Friend, and the other very much offended upraided him in theſe words, What need have I then of thy friendſhip, if thou wilt not do for me what I deſire? made this anſwer, <hi>What need I of thine, if for thy ſake I ſhould do any unhandſome action?</hi> To theſe words were agreeable thoſe deeds, when rather through the diſſention of the two Orders, than for any fault of his own, he was arraign'd, he neither put on ſorry Cloaths, nor laid aſide the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Ornaments, nor made any Supplication to the Judges, nor ſpoke any thing unworthy the ſplendour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41263:146"/>of his paſt years: But ſo order'd it, that his Tryal was rather an Experiment, than any Impediment of his Gravity. And when <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victories gave him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to return into his own Countrey, he rather choſe to tarry in Baniſhment, than to do any thing againſt the Laws. And therefore more juſtly might we have given the Title of Happy to the Manners of ſo grave a Man, than to the proſperous Arms of the other more potent Conquerour. Which <hi>Sylla</hi> uſurp'd, but <hi>Ruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> deſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>M.

                     <p n="1">1. The perſon beforementioned puts me in mind to relate what was ſaid to <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> For when all <hi>Luſitania</hi> had ſurrendred it ſelf to him, and only the City of <hi>Cinninia</hi> obſtinately held out, and that the Conſul thought to have bought them out, they preſently made anſwer to his Commiſſioners, <hi>That their Anceſtors had only left them their Swords to defend their City, but no Money to purchaſe their Liberty from a covetous General.</hi> A Saying more noble for <hi>Romans</hi> to have ſpoken, than to have heard from others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nature led them into theſe paths of Severity. But <hi>Socrates,</hi> the moſt famous Pillar of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he was to plead his own Cauſe at <hi>Athens,</hi>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:41263:147"/>and that <hi>Lycias</hi> had repeated to him an Oration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by himſelf, for him to make uſe of in the Court of Judicature; humble, ſuppliant, and accommodated to the danger that threatned him; <hi>Take it away,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for if I could be brought where I might repeat it, in the farthermoſt deſerts of</hi> Scythia, <hi>there I ſhould think I deſerved death.</hi> He contemn'd Life, that he might not want Gravity; chooſing rather to dye like <hi>Socrates,</hi> than to live like <hi>Lyſias.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. As great as he in Wiſdome, <hi>Alexander,</hi> as great in War, ſhewed himſelf to be of the ſame mind. For <hi>Darius</hi> having tried his force in two Battles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offering him a part of his Kingdome, and his Daughter in Marriage with Ten Hundred thouſand Talents; when <hi>Parmenio</hi> told him, that if he were <hi>Alexander</hi> he would accept the Condition: He made anſwer, <hi>And ſo would I, were I</hi> Parmenio.

This was the effect of a magnanimous Minde in Proſperity; That more generous, whereby the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Ambaſſadors teſtified to his Father the miſerable condition of their fortune.

                  <p>'TIs now time to enter the ſacred receſſes of Juſtice, where alwaies the reſpect of juſt and honeſt Actions is converſant with Religious Obſervation. Where Modeſty is ſtudied, and Deſire gives way to Reaſon; there nothing is reputed profitable that is not honeſt. Of which our City among all Nations is the moſt certain and principal Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Camillus</hi> the Conſul beſieg'd the <hi>Faliſci,</hi> a School-maſter brought over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Youths, and thoſe the moſt noble in the City, under pretence of taking them to walk abroad. Not queſtioning but they being in the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Faliſci</hi> would ſubmit themſelves to our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Upon which affair, after conſultation, the Senate decreed that the Youths ſhould be ſent home, laſhing their Maſter all the way, while his hands were tyed behind him. Which Juſtice of theirs overcame the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41263:148"/>Minds of thoſe, whoſe Walls they were not able to expugn. For the <hi>Faliſci</hi> overcome by their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, not by their Arms, open'd their Gates to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The ſame City oftentimes rebelling, but alwaies broken by adverſe Fortune, was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield to <hi>Q. Lutatius</hi> the Conſul. Againſt which when the <hi>Roman</hi> People deſir'd to have ſhewn the extremity of their Revenge, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from <hi>Papyrius,</hi> who by the Conſuls command had writ the Articles of Surrender, that the <hi>Faliſci</hi> had ſurrender'd themſelves to the Faith, not to the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they laid aſide all their Anger, leſt they ſhould be wanting to their Juſtice; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the force of their Hatred, which is not eaſily overcome; and the pride of Victory, which eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Licentiouſneſs. Another time when <hi>P. Claudius</hi> having by his proſperous conduct taken the <hi>Camerini,</hi> had ſold them under the Spear according to cuſtome, though thereby they ſaw their Exchequer filled with Money, and their Empire enlarged: yet becauſe it did not ſeem to be done according to the Rules of Honour and Juſtice, they ſought them diligently out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them again; aſſigning them a place of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Aventinum,</hi> and reſtoring them their Lands: They gave them Money alſo to build Chappels and purchaſe Sacrifices; and by their Juſtice gave the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable an occaſion to rejoyce in their deſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo rais'd again.</p>
                  <p>What I have related was confin'd within our own Walls and the neighbouring parts; what I now relate has flown over all the world. <hi>Timochares</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracian</hi> promis'd <hi>Fabritius</hi> the Conſul, that he would poyſon <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> by the aſſiſtance of his Son, who was his Cupbearer. Notice whereof being given to the Senate, they ſent Embaſſadors to give <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of it, admoniſhing him to be careful againſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41263:148"/>ſuch kind of treachery. Remembring that their City was built by the Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> and that War was to be carried on by Arms, and not by Poyſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Admirable was the Juſtice of the four Tribunes of the People at the ſame time. For when <hi>L. Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> their Colleague had cited <hi>C. Atratinus</hi> (under whoſe comand they had rallyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and reſtor'd the Battle againſt the <hi>Volſci</hi> at the Lake <hi>Verrugo</hi>) to appear before the People; they ſwore, that it would be a ſhame to them, if their General ſhould be guilty. For thoſe noble Gentlemen would not endure to behold him as a Gown-man under the laſt extremity, whoſe Life, when in Arms, they had defended with their own Wounds and Blood. Which Juſtice of theirs ſo moved the Aſſembly, that they caus'd <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to deſiſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor did they ſhew themſelves leſs noble in that which follows. When <hi>Titus Gracchus</hi> and <hi>C. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> had exaſperated the greateſt part of the City, by carrying themſelves ſo ſeverely in the Cenſorſhip, <hi>Rutilius</hi> the Tribune accus'd them before the People of High-Treaſon; moved not only by the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, but his own private intereſt, becauſe they had order'd a part of his wall to be pulled down for the benefit of ſome Publick-place. In which Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while many Centuries of the firſt Claſſis openly condemn'd <hi>Claudius,</hi> but all conſented to quit <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus; Gracchus</hi> cried out aloud, <hi>That if his Colleague ſuffered, he would undergo the ſame puniſhment as he did.</hi> Which Juſtice of his diverted the ſtorm from both their heads and fortunes. For the People abſolved <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> releas'd his Action againſt <hi>Gracchus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Colledge of Tribunes alſo got great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe: for when one of them, <hi>L. Cotta</hi> by name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of his ſacred Authority, denyed to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41263:149"/>pay his Creditors, they decreed, that if he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pay his Debts nor give Security, they would aſſiſt the Creditors in their Appeal: thinking it unjuſt, that the publick Majeſty ſhould be a protection to private Knavery. Thus the Tribunitial Juſtice drew out <hi>Cotta</hi> lurking in the Sanctuary of his employment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of which to come to another Example, <hi>Cn. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> Tribune of the People cited <hi>Marc. Scaurus</hi> before the People, being then Prince of the City, to ruine him, if fortune had favour'd him; or at leaſt to eclipſe his renown by a Criminal Accuſation. While he was thus eagerly thirſting after the blood of <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> a Servant of <hi>Scaurus</hi> came to him by night, and promis'd him to diſcover many great and hainous Crimes, to advance his Accuſation. As a Maſter and an Enemy he conſider'd and weigh'd in his mind the Impeachment with different thoughts, Juſtice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Hatred: For immediately ſhutting his own ears, and the Impeachers mouth, he caus'd him to be carried to <hi>Scaurus.</hi> An Accuſer, I will not ſay, to be belov'd, but rather to be applauded by the perſon accus'd; whom the People, as well for his other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as alſo for this reaſon, created Conſul, Cenſor, and High-Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nor did <hi>L. Craſſus</hi> behave himſelf otherwiſe as to the ſame Example of Juſtice. He had alwaies born a moſt perfect hatred againſt the Name of <hi>Carbo,</hi> as his profeſt Enemy; and yet when a Servant of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s brought him a Cabinet of his Maſters, conteining ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Writings, which he might have made uſe of to his ruine, he ſent the Cabinet, lockt as it was, and his Servant bound, to his Maſter. What Juſtice may we conjecture then flouriſhed among Friends, when Enemies and Impeachers one of another ſo nobly behav'd themſelves!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Sylla</hi> deſired not ſo much his own ſafety, as the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41263:149"/>ruine of <hi>Sulpitius Rufus,</hi> whoſe Tribunitial rage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vex'd him. But when he was baniſh'd, and that he underſtood that he was betray'd by his own Servant, where he lay skulking; that the Fidelity and Juſtice of his Decree might be permanent, he caus'd the Freed-man for his perfidiouſneſs to be thrown down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, together with his freed-mans Cap, which he had purchaſed by his Treachery. A moſt inſolent Victor at other times, now moſt juſt in his Authority.</p>

                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. But that we may not ſeem to forget the Juſtice of Forreigners, <hi>Pittacus</hi> of <hi>Mitylene</hi> was one to whoſe merits his Citizens were either ſo much engaged, or elſe had ſo much confidence in his Vertues, that they offer'd him the Soveraign Authority of their City; which he ſo long kept as the War continued with the <hi>Athenians</hi> about the <hi>Sygaeum,</hi> or poſſeſſion of a piece of ground ſo called. But after he had by a Victory ſetled Peace, he preſently reſign'd his Authority againſt the will of the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> that he might not be the Lord of his City any longer than the neceſſity of affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. And when by the conſent of all the People the half of the Land was offered him, he utterly refus'd the Gift; eſteeming it below himſelf, to leſſen the glory of his Vertue by the greatneſs of his Prey.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I muſt now relate the Prudence of another, that I may alſo relate the Juſtice of another. When <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> had given the <hi>Athenians</hi> wholeſom advice to betake themſelves to their Veſſels, and after that <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> and his Army were driven out of <hi>Greece</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reſtore the antient dignity of the City, and laid up Treaſure ſecretly to raiſe his City to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all <hi>Greece;</hi> he told the People in publick,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41263:150"/>that he had found out ſomething, which if fortune would ſuffer it to be brought to paſs, there could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happen greater or more for the honour of the <hi>Athenian</hi> People; but that it was not a thing to be divulged: and therefore deſired them to appoint ſome perſon, to whom he might privately reveal it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> was deputed. Who when he underſtood that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> intended to have burnt all the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Navy that lay in the Road of <hi>Gytheum,</hi> that it being deſtroyed, the Dominion of the Sea might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, return'd to his fellow Citizens, and told them, <hi>That</hi> Themiſtocles <hi>was hammering that which was very profitable, but very unjuſt.</hi> Preſently the whole Aſſembly, when they heard it was unjuſt, bid him ſay no more of it, and commanded <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to deſiſt from his Enterprize.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nothing more prevalent than the following Examples of Juſtice: <hi>Zaleucus</hi> the <hi>Locrian</hi> having ſtrengthend his City with moſt profitable and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws; when his Son, condemn'd for Adultery, according to the Law made by himſelf, was to have loſt both his Eyes, and all the City interceded for the Son, for ſome time he obſtinately refus'd it, but at length, conſtrain'd by the intreaty of the People, firſt putting out one of his own Eyes and then one of his Sons, he left the uſe of ſight to both. Thus he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Law the puniſhment which it claimed, with a moſt admirable mixture of Juſtice; dividing himſelf into a merciful Father and a juſt Legiſlator.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But ſomething more ſevere was the Juſtice of <hi>Charundas</hi> the <hi>Thurian.</hi> He had pacified the Harangues of his Citizens, that were ſeditious even to blood and violence, making a Law that if any perſon entred the Common-hall with his Sword on, he ſhould be preſently put to death. Some time after, having been in the Countrey and coming home, he preſently call'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41263:150"/>a Hall, and forgetting himſelf enter'd the Hall with his Sword on. Whereupon being minded of the breach of his own Law, by one that ſtood next him; <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the ſame perſon ſhall eſtabliſh it;</hi> and immediately drawing his Sword, fell upon it and died. When it was lawful for him to have defended or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his errour, he rather choſe to make the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publick, than put a ſlur upon Juſtice.</p>

                  <p>WHen this Image is ſet before our eyes, the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Divinity of Truth ſtretches out her right hand, the moſt certain pledg of human Safety. Which how it has flouriſhed in our City, all Nations have been ſenſible of, and we ſhall make evident in a few Examples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Ptolomey</hi> the King had left the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to take the tuition of his Son upon them, the Senate appointed <hi>M. Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> the High-Prieſt, to be Guardian to the young Infant, and ſent him to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for that purpoſe; making uſe of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a famous and moſt upright perſon, whoſe publick Abilities had been ſufficienty known among them, leſt
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41263:151"/>the credit and dignity of the City ſhould have been any way injur'd. This became not only the preſervation, but the ornament of the Royal Infancy; ſo that when he came of age, he knew not of which he had moſt to boaſt, whether in the Fortune of his Father, or the Majeſty of his Tator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Famous alſo was the ſucceeding piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Integrity. A great Navy of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being overthrown near the Coaſt of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> the Captains of the Enemies, quite out of heart, began to think of making ſome overtures of Peace. But when it was argued who ſhould go, <hi>Amilcar</hi> refus'd, for fear leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſerve him as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ſerved <hi>Cor. Aſina</hi> the Conſul, whom they had detain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d a Priſoner in Chains. But <hi>Hanno,</hi> better underſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, very confidently profer'd himſelf. To whom as he was in treaty, when a Tribune of the People ſpoke, and bid him take heed he had not the ſame uſage as the Conſul <hi>Cornelius</hi> had had; both the Conſuls commanding the Tribune to be ſilent: Hanno, cryed they, <hi>from that fear the reputation of our City frees thee.</hi> It had made them famous, that they could be Maſters of ſo great a Captain of their Enemies; but much more famous, that they would not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſame reputation the Conſcript Fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in defending the Priviledges of Embaſſadors. For when <hi>M. Aemilius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> were Conſuls, <hi>Culeo</hi> the Praetor by an order of the Senate caus'd <hi>L. Minutius</hi> and <hi>L. Manlius</hi> to be deliver'd to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embaſſadors by the Heralds themſelves, becauſe they had laid violent hands upon them. The Senate regarding more their own Honour, than the perſons for whoſe ſake they did the Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe Examples the Elder <hi>Africanus</hi> following, when he had taken a Veſſel wherein were ſeveral perſons, and many of the chiefeſt among the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:41263:151"/>Nobility, yet he diſmiſs'd them all untoucht, becauſe they told him, they were ſent as Embaſſadors to him; though he knew it to be an excuſe of their own framing, to avoid the preſent danger; that the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> General might rather ſeem to be deceiv'd, than implor'd in vain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us not forget that noble Act of the Senate, by no means to be omitted. <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Aediles, by reaſon of a Tumult that happen'd, had ſent away the Embaſſadours that came from <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> Which ſo ſoon as the Senate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, they caus'd them to be deliver'd up to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours by the hands of the Heralds, and ſent a Queſtor to convoy them to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> leſt they ſhould receive any injury in their paſſage. Could ſuch a Court as that be ſaid to be a Council of mortal Men, and not rather the Temple of Faith? Which was no leſs admir'd by our Allies, than it was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerv'd in our City.</p>

                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. For before the miſerable ſlaughter of the two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the deſtruction of as many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, the <hi>Saguntines</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd within their own Walls by the victorious Arms of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when they could no longer reſiſt the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> power, they brought forth all their moſt precious things into the Market-place, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the Pile, threw themſelves into the common and publick fire, that they might not be accompted falſe to our Alliance.

                  <p>IT remains that we relate the Fidelity of Servants to their Maſters; ſo much the more praiſe-worthy, by how much it was leaſt expected from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> a moſt celebrated Oratour in the days of our Anceſtors, was accus'd of Inceſt; whoſe Accuſers were obſtinately importunate with the Judges that his Servant might be examin'd for a witneſs;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41263:153"/>becauſe they pretended that he carried the Lanthorn before him, when he went to commit the Fact. He was at that time a beardleſs Youth, and ſaw himſelf ready to be ſent to the Rack, yet never budg'd for it. But when he came home, and ſaw <hi>Antonius</hi> very much troubled about the buſineſs, he earneſtly begg'd of his Maſter, that he might be put to the Rack; affirming, that they ſhould not force a tittle out of his mouth to do him a prejudice. And with a wonderful patience he performed his promiſe: For being laſh'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtripes, ſet upon the Wooden-horſe, and ſear'd with burning plates of Iron, he overthrew the whole force of his Maſters accuſation, by ſtanding firm to his preſervation. Fortune might be deſervedly blam'd, for having impriſon'd ſo pious and ſtout a Soul in the Body of a Slave.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Conſul <hi>C. Marius,</hi> whoſe ill ſucceſs was miſerable at the Siege of <hi>Praeneſte,</hi> ſeeing it in vain to eſcape through a little Myne under ground, and ſlightly wounded by <hi>Theleſinus,</hi> with whom he had deſigned to live, was run through and ſlain by his Servant, to free him from the cruelty of <hi>Sylla;</hi> though he had large promiſes made him, to deliver him up to the Victor. The ſeaſonable aſſiſtance of whoſe right hand, no way ſeems inferiour to the Piety of thoſe who have protected their Maſters in ſafety. Becauſe at that time not Life, but Death was moſt beneficial to <hi>Marius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Equally illuſtrious was the following Example. <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> that he might not fall into the power of his Enemies, laid his neck to be cut off by his Servant <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Others call this Servant <hi>Euporus:</hi> I diſpute not about the name, only I admire the ſtoutneſs of a ſervile Fidelity; the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe Soul had the generous Youth imitated,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41263:153"/>he had avoided the threatning danger, by the benefit of his own and not his Servants hand. But now he gave way that the Carcaſs of <hi>Philocrates</hi> ſhould lye in more ſplendour than that of <hi>Gracchu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> his Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another ſort of Fury, and another ſort of Nobility, but the ſame Example of Fidelity. For <hi>Pindarus,</hi> the Freed-man of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> having ſlain his Maſter by his command, after he had loſt the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> preſerv'd him from the inſultings of his Enemies; nor was the Servant ever ſeen after. Which of the Gods, Revenger of the moſt hainous Crimes of Mortals, ſo benumb'd that Valour, that ventur'd to the deſtruction of the Parent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that it ſhould ſo abjectly trembling ſubmit it ſelf at the knees of <hi>Pindarus,</hi> to avoid the puniſhment of publick Parricide, which it deſerv'd from the hands of a moſt pious Victor? Thou, thou it was, moſt divine <hi>Julius,</hi> that didſt exact the revenge due to thy celeſtial wounds, compelling that proud Head; ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious to thee, to implore the ſordid aid of a Slave, driven to that extremity of fury, that he neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd to live, nor durſt to dye by his own hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of theſe calamities <hi>C. Plotius Plancus,</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Munatius Plancus</hi> both Conſul and Cenſor, was a ſad partaker; who lurking in the Territories of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lernum,</hi> after he had been baniſh'd by the Triumvirs, diſcover'd the Sanctuary of his Safety by his effeminate way of living, and the odours of his ſweet Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For thereby the induſtrious care of thoſe that perſecute the miſerable, ſmelt out his ſecret haunts: By whom the Servants being apprehended, and long tortur'd, denied they knew where their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was. Then would not <hi>Plancus</hi> endure that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſo faithful and exemplary, ſhould be any longer tormented; but diſcover'd himſelf, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Throat to the Souldiers weapons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41263:154"/>conteſt of mutual good Will, makes it difficult to be decided, whether the Maſter were more worthy, who had the trial of ſuch a conſtant Fidelity in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; or the Servants, who were freed from the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Rack, by the juſt compaſſion of their Maſter.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. I might be contented with theſe Examples; but the wonder of the Fact compells me to relate one more. <hi>Antius Reſtio</hi> being proſcrib'd by the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri, when he ſaw all his Servants buſie upon rapine and ranſack, in a tempeſtuous night withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Houſe.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41263:154"/>Anger, he added Charity. Nor did his good Will end here, but be us'd a Stratagem to preſerve his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For when he perceiv'd the Souldiers were at hand, he hid his Maſter, and making a Funeral Pile, got a poor old man whom he ſlew and threw him into the flame. When the Souldiers ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Who is ignorant how highly the Authority of <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> was advanc'd, at that very rime when there was a crowd of famous men living? Whoſe younger years you will finde to have been guilty of much Luxury and Softneſs. Which however was no impediment to him, but that he became the Prince of his Countrey, had the honour to have his name ſhine in the Capitol, and by his own courage to bury a Civil War that was riſing with a mighty force to ſeize the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> till he came to be Queſtor, led a life infamous for his Whoring, Gaming and Drinking. Whereupon it was reported, that <hi>Marius</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a very ſmart War in <hi>Africa,</hi> complain'd that they had ſent him ſuch an effeminate Queſtor. But his Vertue, having as it were broken down the fences of wickedneſs, made a ſhift to chain the hands of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi> quell <hi>Mithridates,</hi> withſtand the billows of the War of our Allies, break the power of <hi>Cinna,</hi> and compel him that had deſpis'd him, when his Queſtor in <hi>Africa,</hi> to fly a proſcrib'd Exile into the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for ſafety. Which ſo various and ſo contrary acts, he that ſhall with a ſerious minde conſider, would believe there were two <hi>Sylla</hi>'s in one man. I would have call'd him a <hi>vicious youth,</hi> but a <hi>brave man,</hi> had he not himſelf aſſum'd the title of <hi>Happy.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs. For he behavd himſelf faithfully and nobly: plainly demonſtrating, that his former way of living, was only the effect of Fortune; but that the preſent advancement of his Dignity, was to be attributed to the greatneſs of his parts.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Publius Rupilius</hi> was no Toll-gatherer in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> but only a mean Officer under them; ſo miſerable poor, that he had nothing to keep Life and Soul together, but a ſmall Office that depended upon the leave of the vanquiſh'd. Yet from him, Conſul afterwards, all <hi>Sicilia</hi> receiv'd their Laws, after he had freed them from the terrors of a ſmart War of the Pirats and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives. I believe that the very Ports themſelves, if there be any ſence in mute things, admir'd the wonderful change in the Condition of that man. For the ſame perſon that they had teen exacting the dayly Cuſtoms, the ſame perſon they ſaw giving Laws to Navies and Armies.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this increaſe of Dignity I will adde a greater. When <hi>Aſculum</hi> was taken, <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, proſtituted to the eyes of the People <hi>P. Ventidius,</hi> a beardleſs Youth, in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph that he had obtain'd. Yet this was that <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius,</hi> who afterwards triumph'd at <hi>Rome</hi> over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and reveng'd the death of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably foyl'd in a ſtrange Countrey. Thus he that a Captive dreaded impriſonment, now a Victor crowns the Capitol with his ſucceſs. And this is farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of the ſame perſon, that he was made
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41263:156"/>Pretor and Conſul both in one and the ſame year.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now let us conſider the diverſities of Chance. <hi>L.

                  <p n="11">11. Thus Fortune ſhew'd her power alſo in <hi>Cn. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Scipio Aſina.</hi> Who when he was Conſul, being taken by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at <hi>Liparae,</hi> and had loſt all by the right of War, yet by the favour of Fortune recovered all, and was again created Conſul. Who would have thought he ſhould have been brought from the Faſces to the Fetters of the <hi>Carthaginians?</hi> Who would have thought again, that from the <hi>Punic</hi> chains he ſhould have advanc'd himſelf to the higheſt degrees of Honour? But yet he was from a Conſul made a Captive, and from a Captive became Conſul.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. What?

                     <p n="1">1. We have been intent in relating our own, let us be more ſuccinct in the repetition of Forreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. <hi>Polemo,</hi> a young <hi>Athenian</hi> Gentleman, but infinitely debauch'd, and one that gloried in his ſhame, riſing from a Banquet, not after Sun-ſet, but after Sun-riſing, as he went home ſaw <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Philoſopher's door ſtanding wide open. Drunk as he was, richly perfum'd, gayly clad, and with his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land upon his Head, he enter'd the School, that was full of Grave and Learned Men; and nothing aſham'd of the manner of his entry, he ſate down to throw his drunken Jeſts upon the noble Diſputes and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Precepts that were then utter'd. The company being offended, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> kept his temper, and began to diſpute of Modeſty and Temperance. The Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of whoſe Speech cauſing <hi>Polemo</hi> to repent, he firſt threw his Garland to the ground, preſently after he withdrew his arms (<hi>a token of Modeſty among the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians) under his Cloak; ſhortly after he left his feaſting Mirth; and laſtly, laid aſide all his Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and being cur'd with the wholeſome Medicine of one Oration, of an infamous Glutton became a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſopher. For his minde was only a Pilgrim in wickedneſs, not an Inhabitant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It troubles me to remember <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in his Youth; whether I conſider his Father that diſinherited him, or his Mother that hang'd herſelf to ſee the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked courſe of life her Son led; when he himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became the moſt famous perſon that ever <hi>Greece</hi> brought forth; and was the pledge either of hope or deſpair between <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> For the one had him the Patron of her Safety, the other entertain'd him as the Surety of Victory.</p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:41263:158"/>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cimon</hi> in his youth was look'd upon as a fool; but the <hi>Athenians</hi> found the benefit of his fooliſh commands: Compelling them to condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſtupidity, who had accus'd him of Folly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Two diſtinct Fortunes ſhar'd <hi>Alcibiades</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The one, that aſſign'd him a ſplendid Nobility, vaſt Wealth, Beauty incomparable, ſtrength of Body, a moſt piercing Wit, and the paſſionate love of his Countrey-men: The other, that inflicted upon him Condemnaton, Baniſhment, Sale of his Eſtate, Poverty, the hatred of his Countrey, and a violent Death. Neither the one nor the other altogether, but by intermiſſion, like the ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Polycrates,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Samos,</hi> lived in ſuch a prodigality of Fortunes favours, that he was admir'd even to Envy, not without cauſe; his endeavors all proſper'd; his hopes reap'd the fruit of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; his wiſhes were no ſooner nam'd than granted: To deſire, and be able to perform, was the ſame thing. Once only Fortune chang'd her coutenance, when he threw a Ring, which he highly eſteem'd, into the Sea, that he might not be ſaid to have undergone no misfortune; which however he preſently recover'd, the fiſh being taken that had ſwallowed it. But he could not always hold this proſperous courſe of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that ſwell'd his full ſails: For <hi>Orontes,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Commanders, having taken him, caus'd him to be crucified upon the higheſt top of the <hi>Mycalenſian</hi> Mountain. From whence the City of <hi>Samos,</hi> long oppreſſed by his ſevere Tyranny, with the joyful eyes of freemen beheld his ſtinking Arteries, his members beſmear'd with Blood, and that left hand, to whom <hi>Neptune</hi> had reſtor'd the Ring by the hand of the Fiſherman, the ſad ſpectacle of Misfortune.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> alſo when he had enter'd upon the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41263:158"/>Tyranny of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by his Fathers Will, the Lord of a vaſt Wealth, a Captain of Armies, an Admiral of a Navy, potent in Horſe, yet was forced to teach School at <hi>Corinth,</hi> for his livelihood: And at the ſame time, of a Tyrant being now become a School-maſter, he warn'd his Elders by ſuch a change, how little they were to truſt to Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Next to him follows <hi>Syphax</hi> the King, who underwent the ſame ſeverity of Fortune; to whom however at the ſame time, <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Scipio, Carthage</hi> by <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> made their addreſſes for his Friendſhip. But while he ſtood thus courted, that he ſeem'd to be an Arbiter of Victory between the greateſt and moſt potent People in the world; In a ſhort time after, he was brought chain'd by <hi>Laelius</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and now lyes proſtrate at the feet of him, whom he thought it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour enough before, as he fate upon his Throne, to take by the hand. Thus meerly vain, and fragil, and like the baubles Children play with, are thoſe great things which we call Human Power and Wealth: On a ſuddain they abound, and vaniſh as ſoon: In no place or perſon fix'd upon a ſtable foundation; but toſs'd hither and thither by the uncertain ſtate of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, miſerably they precipitate them into the depth of Calamity, whom but now they had exalted as high as Heaven. And therefore they are neither to be eſteemed nor accompted Felicity, which to the end they may redouble a deſire of enjoying them, are wont to oppreſs with a heavier weight, thoſe that they flatter'd before with their moſt indulgent ſavours.</p>

                  <p>WE have related ſeveral Examples of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of Fortune; for there are very few that render her propitious. Whereby it is evident that ſhe is generous and free of her Adverſity, but very ſparing of her Proſperity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us ſee then with how many degrees of favour ſhe proſecuted <hi>Metellus</hi> from his Infancy to his Death, with an inceſſant indulgence. She gave him his birth in the Capital City of the World: She gave him moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parents: She furniſh'd him with admirable parts of Nature, and ſtrength of Body: She married him to a Wife conſpicuous for her Chaſtity &amp; Fertility: She grac'd him with the Honour of Conſulſhip, the Imperatorian Dignity, and the Splendour of a renowned Triumph: She ſo order'd it, that at the ſame time he had three Sons living, Conſular men; one alſo a Cenſor and Triumpher; and the fourth a Pretor. She married him Three Daughters, whoſe Iſſue he received into his own boſom: And among all theſe Children born, ſo many Youths coming to age, ſo many Nuptial Torches, ſuch an abundance of Honour, Empire and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, not one Funeral, not one Tear, or the leaſt

Nor was his end unlike the courſe of his Life. For after he had liv'd a fair age, an eaſie Death carried him off from the laſt farewels and embraces of his deareſt Pledges; and he was carried to his Funeral-Pile upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Sons and Sons-in. Law through the City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A noble Felicity this; yet the following was prefer'd by the Divinity it ſelf. For when <hi>Gyges,</hi> puſt up with the riches and power of his Kingdom of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> went to enquire of <hi>Pythrian Apollo,</hi> whether any Mortal was happier than he; The God made anſwer with a low voice, from the hollow retirement of his ſacred Den, that <hi>Aglaus Sophidius</hi> was more happy than he. He was the pooreſt of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> but the elder of the two: one that never had increas'd the bounds of his own land; contented with the Income of a poor Farm. But <hi>Apollo</hi> meant the true, not the obſcure end of a happy Life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave that anſwer to one that inſolently gloried in the ſplendour of his fortune, That he rather approv'd a Cottage in a calm ſecurity of content, than the cares and anxieties of a Court; a few clods of earth void of fear, than all the fertile Acres of <hi>Lydia</hi> incumber'd with continual dread; and one or two yoak of Oxen eaſily maintain'd, than Armies of Horſe and Foot, burthenſome even to vaſt expences; and a ſmall Barn ſubject to no mans Envy, than Exchequers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the covetous deſires and rapacious violence of all men. Thus while <hi>Gyges</hi> labours to finde a God to favour his vain opinion, he learns wherein the true and ſolid Happineſs conſiſts.</p>

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41263:165"/>would not meet with the credit of what it propounded, did it not aſſume the force of Craft; and ſeeks for applauſe rather in a hidden path, than in an open way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the reign of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> a certain Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord in the <hi>Sabine</hi> Territories had a Cow of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bigneſs and beauty. Which certain Authors of the Oracles ſaid was ſent into the world by the Immortal Gods, to the end that whoever offer'd it to <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Aventinum,</hi> his Countrey ſhould obtain the Empire over the whole World. The Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to hear ſuch tydings, drave the beaſt with all ſpeed, and preſented it before the Altar of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Aventinum,</hi> deſirous to give the Honour of Supreme Empire to the <hi>Sabines.</hi> Of which the Preſident of the Temple having notice, put it into the Owner's head, that before he ſlew the Sacrifice, he ſhould waſh himſelf in the water of the next River: who for that reaſon haſtening to <hi>Tybur,</hi> while he was gone, the chief Prieſt offer'd the beaſt, and by a pious theft of the Sacrifice, rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r'd our City the Miſtreſs of ſo many Cities and Nation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For which ſharpneſs of Wit, <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> is in the firſt place to be commended. For when he found all the Promiſing Nobility to be cut off by King <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius</hi> his Uncle, and that his Brother was by him put to death, becauſe of the forwardneſs of his Wit, counterfeited himſelf to be a Fool; and by that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy conceal'd his own vaſt parts. Going alſo to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> with the Sons of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> whom their Father ſent thither with rich Preſents and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in honour of <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi>he carri'd Gold as a Preſent to the Deity, hid in a hollow ſtick; fearing that it was not ſafe to worſhip the Celeſtial Deity with
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41263:166"/>an open Liberality. After that, the Young-men, having performed their Father, s commands, conſulted <hi>Apollo,</hi> which among them all ſhould be the perſon that ſhould reign in <hi>Rome.</hi> The God made anſwer, <hi>That he ſhould obtain the Soveroignty, that gave his Mother the firſt kiſs.</hi> Then <hi>Brutus</hi> threw himſelf ſo down, as if he had fallen by chance, and kiſs'd the Earth, the common Mother of all things. Which crafty Riſs given to the Earth, gave Liberty to our City, and the firſt place in our Annals to <hi>Brutus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Scipio</hi> alſo the Elder embrac'd the aid of Craft, For as he was to ſay from <hi>Sicily</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> finding it neceſſary to compleat a Body of Three Hundred Horſe out of the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot; though he had not time to exerciſe them, what the ſtreitneſs of Time denied him, he attained by the Sagacity of his Counſel. For of all the young Gentlemen, which were the nobleſt and the richeſt, that he carried with him out of <hi>Sicily</hi> unarm'd, he chooſe out Three Hundred, whom he order'd to furniſh themſelves with gay Weapons and ſelect Horſes, as if he intended to carry them along with him to the ſtorming of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> Who obeying his command, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ſpeed, as in reſpect of a far diſtant and dangerous War, <hi>Scipio</hi> told them, he would releaſe them from the Expedition, upon condition they would deliver up their Weapons and Horſes to his Souldiers. The Young-men effeminate and fearful, greedily accepted the Condition, and willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up their preparations to our Souldiers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Subtilety of the Captain provided, that what was out of hand commanded, though ſevere at firſt, ſhould be lookt upon as a greater benefit, the ſear of ſervice being remitted.</p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:41263:166"/>
                  <p n="4">4. That which follows is alſo to be related. <hi>Q. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Lubeo</hi> being by the Senate appointed an Arbitrator to ſettle the Bounds between the <hi>Nolans</hi> and the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> when they came to the buſineſs, admoniſh'd both apart, that laying aſide all Covetouſneſs, they ſhould rather abate, than pretend to too much. Which when both ſides had contented to, mov'd thereto by the authority of the perſon, there was ſome ground left. Thereupon the Bounds being ſet as they had agreed to, that which was left he adjudged to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> But though neither the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> nor <hi>Neapolitans</hi> could in Juſtice complain, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence king given by their own conſent; yet by a new kind of mental reſervation, it brought a new Tribute to our City. The ſame perſon, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Articles to have half the Navy of King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whom he had overthrown in Battle, cut all the Ships in two, and ſo depriv'd him of his whole Navy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now are we to excuſe <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> who ſaid, That he never publiſh'd any Oration, to the end that if any Judgment of his formerly given ſhould chance to hinder him that he ſhould next defend, he might aver that he never ſpake it. Which ſeem'd a reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for a fact hardly allowable. For he was ſtill ready not only to make uſe of his Eloquence, but to injure his Modeſty to ſave his Client.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>Sertorius,</hi> upon whom Nature had with an equal indulgence beſtow'd both ſtrength of Body, and ſagacity in Counſel, being compell'd to be Captain of the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> by the proſcription of <hi>Sylla,</hi> when he could by no means perſwade them but that they would fight with the whole Army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by his crafty Counſel brought them to do as he intended.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41263:167"/>For he placed in the ſight of all the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> two Horſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one a ſtout beaſt, the other weak and infirm. After that he caus'd the Tail of the ſtrong Horſe ſo be pull'd hair by hair from him, by a weak old man; and the Tail of the weak Horſe to be torn all at once from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a young fellow of an egregious ſtrength. His commands were obey'd. But while the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man toyl'd himſelf in vain, the decrepit old-man did his buſineſs. Then to let the Barbarous Aſſembly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of his project, he added, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Army was like the tail of the Horſe, which might be eaſily overcome in parts; but that whoever aſſail'd the body entire, ſhould ſooner looſe than gain the Victory.</hi> Thus the Barbarous rough-hewn Nation, ruſhing on to their own deſtruction, ſaw with their Eyes the advantages which their Ears had refus'd.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by abſtaining from fight, having in his Camp a <hi>Nolan</hi> Footman of prodigious ſtrength, yet ſuſpected for his Fideliry, and a <hi>Lucan</hi> Horſeman of equal ſtoutneſs, both captivated with the ſame Curtezan; to the end he might not looſe the advantage of two ſuch Souldiers, diſſembled his ſuſpicion to the one, and as to the other he ſomewhat ſurpaſſed the bounds of true Diſcipline. For by praiſing the one in the publick Tribunal, and loading him with all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, he made him conſtant to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and an enemy to the <hi>Corthaginians;</hi> and the other he ſuffer'd to redeem his Miſtreiſs privately, that he might become an exact Spy for our ſide.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I will come now to thoſe that ſaved themſelves by Craft. <hi>M. Voluſius</hi> a baniſh'd Aedile of the People, diſguiſing himſelf in the habit of a Prieſt of <hi>Iſis,</hi> while he begg'd as he travelled upon the Road, kept himſelf from being known who he was. And in this diſguiſe he came to the Camp of <hi>M. Brutus.</hi> What more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41263:167"/>than Neceſſity, which conſtrain'd a Magiſtrate of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> laying aſide his Robes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, under the diſguiſe of a forraign Religion, to beg from Town to Town? But all theſe were either too deſirous of Life, or too covetous of the Death of others, who could either endure ſuch things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or compell'd others to undergo ſuch difficulties.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Something more noble was that ſhift, at a dead lift, of <hi>Sentius Saturninus Vetulio,</hi> who hearing his name among thoſe that were proſcrib'd by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs, preſently laid hold upon the Enſigns of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority born before the Praetor, and pretending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a publick <hi>Lictor,</hi> or Serjeant, he did it with that confidence, that in the midſt of all his enemies, he hid himſelf from their ſight in the midſt of day light. After that coming to <hi>Puteoli,</hi> and pretending himſelf in publick employment, he ſo carried himſelf, that he commanded a Veſſel to carry him without controul into <hi>Sicily,</hi> the ſafe refuge of the proſcrib'd Party at that time.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. One more ſlight Example, and then to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners. A certain perſon, extraordinarily indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to his Son, being deſirous to retrieve him from a dangerous and unlawful Amour, intermix'd his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indulgence with the craft of wholeſome Counſel. For he deſir'd him before he went to his Miſtreſs, to make uſe of that ſort of Venery which was common and permitted. Whereupon the Youngman, liſtening to his Fathers entreaties, finding himſelf ſatiated by a lawful act, ceas'd to proſecute any farther his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heat of concupiſcence.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Alexander</hi> King of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> admoniſh'd by the Oracle that he ſhould put to death whoever
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41263:168"/>he met firſt coming out of the Gate, met a Driver of Aſſes, whom he commanded to be preſently carried to execution. The Aſe-driver thereupon beſought him, wherefore he went about to put an innocent perſon to death, that had done him no offence? To whom when the King repeated the command of the Oracle; <hi>If it be ſo, O King,</hi> ſaid the Aſs-driver, <hi>the Oracle aſſign'd another to dye, and not me: For the Aſs that I drove met thee before I did.

Here was an extraordinary mildneſs joyned with ſubtilty; but a more extraordinary ſubtilty in the other Kings Groom, is this which follows.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the fordid dominion of the <hi>Magi</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, <hi>Darius</hi> the King, joyning with others of the ſame Dignity, made a noble contract with them, that they ſhould be on Horſeback by Sun-riſing ſo ride to ſuch a place, and that he ſhould enjoy the Kingdome whoſe Horſe firſt neigh'd. But while the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for ſo great an honour only waited upon Fortune, <hi>Darius</hi> by the pure invention of <hi>Ebar</hi> the Maſter of his Horſe, attain'd his wiſh: For he coming to the place, put his hand which he had but a little before thruſt into the privy parts of a Mare, to the Noſtrils of his Maſters Horſe; who provok'd by the Scent, immediately neighed. Which the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors no ſooner heard, but immediately throwing themſelves from their horſes, and proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve? upon the ground (as is the manner of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>) they ſaluted <hi>Darius</hi> King. How vaſt an Empire was thus obtain'd by ſo ſlight a piece of Cunning!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Bias,</hi> whoſe wiſdome has bin more durable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, than his Countrey of <hi>Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not that he thought to obtain his deſire; but that the People might have wherewithal to blunt the edge of their firſt Anger, which is uſually the ſharpeſt. Nor did his Policy deceive him: for when the People had ſpent their malice in hiſſing him out the Aſſembly, and had diſgrac'd him by laying him aſide, when he came to plead for his Life, their malice turn'd into compaſſion, as if they had done enough againſt him before. For if he had ventur'd his life among them while they were thirſting after Revenge, he had found their Ears ſtopp'd againſt all Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Like to this was the following piece of Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Elder <hi>Hannibal</hi> being overthrown by <hi>Dui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in a Sea-fight, and fearing the lots of his Head for the loſs of his Fleet, by an admirable act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty mitigated his crime: For before the news of his Overthrow got home, he ſends one of his Friends to <hi>Carthage</hi> in a gentile Habit. Who coming into the Senate-Houſe; <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>has ſent me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with you, Whether, if he meet the</hi> Roman <hi>Admiral and finde him too numerous, he ſhall fight or no?</hi> When the whole Senate were unanimouſly for fighting; <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he has fought, and is overcome.</hi> And then it was too late to condemn the fact, which they themſelves had approv'd.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The other <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi>'s delay ſo prejudicial to his Victories, to render him ſuſpected of ſpinning out the War, while he waſted all other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> with Fire and Sword, he only ſpar'd his Farm. And the crafty act of kindneſs had taken effect, had not the piety of <hi>Fabius</hi> and the wily tricks of <hi>Hannibal</hi> bin too well known to the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Tuſculans</hi> alſo ſav'd themſelves by the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Councils. For when by their frequent Rebellions they merited the total deſtruction of their City, and that <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> was ſent for the ſame purpoſe with a very powerful Army, they all came forth to meet him in their Gowns, bringing him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and offering him all other as at Peace and Friendſhip, while their Shops were open as at other times. By which Conſtancy of theirs, they not only obtain'd our Friendſhip, but became alſo incorporated with our City.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But wicked was the counſel of <hi>Tullus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Volſci;</hi> who being eager to make War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> finding after the loſs of ſeveral Battles, that his own People began to encline to Peace;by a ſubtile way of reaſoning, made 'em do what he pleaſed. For it happening that a great multitude of the <hi>Volſci</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to behold the Publick Shews, he told the Conſuls, he was afraid they would contrive ſome miſchief, being ſo numerous; advis'd them to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and preſently left the City himſelf. This the Conſuls related to the Senate, who though they knew no reaſon for it, yet upon <hi>Tullus</hi>'s. words, voted the <hi>Volſci</hi> to depart the City. By which contempt the <hi>Volſci</hi> incenſed, were eaſily induced to Rebellion. Thus with a Lye, mask'd in Kindneſs, did a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Captain deceive two Nations: The <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to abuſe the Innocent, and the deceived <hi>Volſci</hi> to revenge the injury.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fidene,</hi> a City that kept the growing infancy of our City waking, and nouriſhing her Vertue with neighbouring Trophies and Triumphs, taught her to aſpire farther, was aſſail'd by <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> all his forces At that time <hi>Metius Suffetius,</hi> in the field, when the Battles were ready to joyn, diſcover'd the falſity of his heart, which he had a long time kept conceal'd. For leaving the wing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, he drew Off to a Hill, where he reſolv'd to be a Spectator ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an Aſſiſtant; intending either to triumph over the vanquiſh'd, or to fall upon the weary Victors. No queſtion but it diſcourag'd our Souldiers to ſee themſelves forſaken by their Allies, at the very time when they were going to fight their Enemies. To prevent which, <hi>Tullus</hi> riding ſwiftly about the Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, cryed out, <hi>That</hi> Metius <hi>had drawn off by his
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41263:170"/>command, and that he was to fall upon the back of the</hi> Fidenates <hi>when he gave the ſigne.</hi> And by that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an expert General, he chang'd their Fear into Confidence, and fill'd their breaſts with Chearfulneſs inſtead of Conſternation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that I may not preſently leave our Kings; <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> fretting to ſee that the <hi>Gabii</hi> could not be taken by his Father's Army, found out a trick more powerful than Weapons themſelves, whereby he over-reach'd the Town, and joyn'd it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Gabii,</hi> counterfeiting himſelf to be fled from his Fathers ſtripes and ſeverity. After that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the good will of every one by his kind and winning behaviour, when he had won that, he ſent his Servant to his Father, to tell him how he had every thing in his hands, and to deſire him to know what he ſhould do. The old mans Craft was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the youngs mans ſubtilty. For <hi>Tarquin</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the news, yet not confiding in the Meſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ger, return'd no anſwer, but carrying him into the Garden, ſtrook of the heads of the higheſt and biggeſt Poppies with his Cane. The young man underſtanding his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and what he had done, concluded there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning in the thing: which was, that he ſhould either baniſh or put to death all the Chief Heads of the <hi>Gabii.</hi> Whereby he deliveir'd up the City empty of defenders, and yet the peoples; hands were not tyed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prudently alſo and proſperouſly was it provided by our Anceſtors, when our City being taken, the Capitol was beſieg'd by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who deſpair'd of taking it any other way than by famiſhing the beſieg'd. For by how cunning an act of deliberation did they deprive the Victors of their only motive to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, by caſting Loaves of Bread out of the Capitol
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41263:171"/>into ſeveral parts of the Beſieger-Line! At which ſight they were ſo amaz'd, and thought us to be ſo well ſtor'd, that they were conſtrain'd to raiſe their Siege. Certainly <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf took compaſſion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Courage, which then borrow'd aſſiſtance from Craft; ſeeing them in the height of want, to waſte the ſupport of Life: And therefore he proſper'd the cunning Stratagem with a proſperous event.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſame <hi>Jupiter</hi> afterwards became propitious to the crafty Councils of our Captains. For when <hi>Hannibal</hi>

For <hi>Nero</hi> curbing <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Lucans,</hi> making a ſhew of ſtill attending the Enemy (for ſo the reaſon of War requir'd) with long and ſpeedy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haſtens to the aſſiſtance of his Colleague. <hi>Salinator</hi> being then in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria</hi> by the River <hi>Metaurus,</hi> and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fight the next day, with an extraordinary Policy received <hi>Nero</hi> by night. For he order'd the Tribunes to be receiv'd by the Tribunes, the Centurions by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions, the Horſemen by the Horſemen, the Foot by the Footmen; and ſo without any tumult, he ingrafted two Armies into one, in the ſame ground that was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to contain that which he had before. Whereby it hapned that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> knew not that he fought with two Conſuls, before he was by both overthrown. And thus was the <hi>Punic</hi> faith, ſo infamous over all the world, deluded at its own Weapon: while the <hi>Roman</hi> Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence deliver'd up <hi>Hannibal</hi> to the Wiles of <hi>Nero, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi> to the Deceit of <hi>Salinator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Memorable alſo was the Counſel of <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> who together with the Proconſul warring againſt the

                     <hi>Celtiberians</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and finding himſelf too weak to force <hi>Contrebia</hi> the Metropolis of that Countrey, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving many thoughts in his minde, at length he found a way to bring his buſineſs to perfection. He made tedious marches, ſometimes he fell upon this Province, ſometimes upon another; ſometimes he aſſail'd theſe Paſſages of the Mountains, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times others: and all this while, as well his own Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as the Enemy, were amazed to ſee him whirl from one place to another in that manner. For which reaſon being ask'd by one of his intimate friends, why he made ſuch a looſe and ſcatter'd kind of War? <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to enquire,</hi> ſaid he: <hi>for if I thought my ſhirt knew the meaning of this deſigne of mine, I would cauſe it to be burnt.</hi> How far did this diſſimulation extend? Or what was the iſſue of it? But when he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd both his own Army and the Enemy in the ſame errour, faining to march another way, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly turn'd back upon <hi>Contrebia,</hi> and ſo ſurpriz'd it unawares. So that if he had not ſuffer'd his thoughts to ſearch after Wiles and Stratagems, he might have lain before <hi>Contrebia</hi> all the days of his life.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Agathocles,</hi> King of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> was boldly cunning: For when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had poſſeſs'd the greateſt part of his City, he tranſported his Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> to diſpel fear by fear, and force by force; and not without ſucceſs. For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at his ſuddain coming, willingly redeem'd their own ſecurity by the ſafety of the enemy; So that it was agreed, that at the ſame time <hi>Africa</hi> ſhould be freed from the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> from the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi> For had he perſever'd to preſerve the Walls of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> they had been ſtill vex'd with the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

Then in the very time of fight, he caus'd great part of his Army to counterfeit a flight; which when the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion follow'd, as it was divided from the reſt of the Army, he provided that they ſhould be cut to pieces by the Ambuſh which he had laid to entrap them. Then he order'd four hundred Horſe to go to the Conſul like Revolters; who being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lay aſide their Weapons, and to retire into the Rear of the Army, in the heat of the Fight, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords, which they privately conceal'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Veſts and Armour, cut the Hams of the engaged <hi>Romans.</hi> Thus was the <hi>Punic</hi> Fortitude fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Deceit, Ambuſhment, and Fallacy.

                  <p>MOſt bitter are the Laws of abominable Neceſſity, and moſt ſevere her Commands, which have compell'd not only our City, but alſo forraign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſuffer many things grievous, not only to the underſtanding, but alſo to the hearing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For in the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War, the Youth of <hi>Rome</hi> being exhauſted, the Senate, at the motion of <hi>Titus Gracchus</hi> Conſult elect, order'd, that Servants might be publickly bought, to ſerve againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Which being reported by the Tribunes to the people, three perſons were choſen out to buy four and twenty thouſand Servants; who ſwearing them to be true, faithful and courageous, while the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> continued in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſent them away to the Camp. Out of <hi>Apulia</hi> alſo and the Territories of <hi>Fidicule</hi> two hundred and ſeventy Horſemen were bought to ſupply the Horſe. How great is the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of bitter Chance! That City which till that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41263:174"/>time loath'd to have Souldiers whoſe heads were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tax'd, that very City is now conſtrain'd to hale the bodies of Slaves from their ſervile dens, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the Cottages of Shepherds, to be the chief ſtrength of their Army. Generous ſpirits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ſometimes give way to convenience, and ſubmit to the power of Fortune, where he that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not the ſafeſt Counſel, yields to him that follows the moſt ſpecious Advice. But the ſlaughter of <hi>Cannae</hi> ſo amaz'd our City, that by the induſtry of <hi>Marcus Junius,</hi> then ordering the affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as Dictator, the ſpoils of the Enemies fix'd in the Temples conſecrated to the Gods, were taken down for the ſervice of the Wars, and the youth of the Nobility were forced to take Arms; and ſix Thouſand condemn'd perſons were alſo liſted our of neceſſity. Which things conſider'd in themſelves, ſeem to look ſomewhat odly; but weighed in the balance of neceſſity, they appear to be helps fit for the ſeverity of the times. By reaſon of the ſame Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, the Senate wrote back in anſwer to <hi>Otacilius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Mammula,</hi> the one Propraetor of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the other of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> who both complain'd that they had neither Money nor Proviſions for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, That they had not Money in the Treaſury for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expences, and therefore bid them take the beſt courſe they could to provide for themſelves.

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Caſilinates</hi> wanting Victuals, and being cloſely beſieg'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> took all the Leathern Thongs from their neceſſary uſes, and the Leather
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41263:175"/>Covers from their Targets, and boyling them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were forc'd to feed upon them. Conſider but the bitterneſs of the Calamity, and what could be more miſerable? If you conſider their Conſtancy, what greater mark of Fidelity? Who rather than they would deſert the <hi>Romans,</hi> maintain'd themſelves with ſuch a ſort of Diet, when ſuch fat Fields, and ſuch a fertile Soyls, joyn'd ſo cloſe to their Walls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When that Town was ſo beſieg'd, and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully held out, it hapned that one among Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Praeneſtines</hi> having taken a Mouſe, would rather ſell it for Two Hundred <hi>Denaries,</hi> than eat it himſelf, notwithſtanding the famiſhing condition he was in. But Providence allotted both to the Buyer and the Seller, the end which they both deſerv'd. For the covetous perſon being ſtarv'd to death, enjoy'd not the ſpoils of his Avarice; but he that was at ſo great an expence for his own preſervation, though he bought it dear, yet ſince it was out of Neceſſity, liv'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Conſulſhip of <hi>C. Marius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Carbo,</hi> who contended in a Civil War with <hi>Sylla,</hi> and at what time the Commonwealth did not ſeek for Victory, but that the Publick was to be the Victors reward; by a Decree of the Senate, the Gold and Silver Ornaments of the Temples were melted down, to pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. For it was a worthy contention, whether the one ſhould be permitted to ſatiate his Cruelty with the baniſhment of the Citizens, or whether the Immortal Gods ſhould be rob'd. But it was not the will of the Conſcript Fathers, but thine, Dire Neceſſity, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd that order to be made.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the divine <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41263:175"/>to ſtrengthen 'em, Neceſſity teaching them a new way of Fortification.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And that I may adde the heavenly mention of the Son, to the remembrance of the celeſtial Father; when <hi>Phraates</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> threatned to break in upon our Provinces, and that the adjoyning Regions were terrified at the news of their coming, there was ſuch a Famine in the Region of <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> that the Souldiers exchang'd ſo many Slaves for a ſingle Veſſel of Oyle, and ſo many Slaves for a Buſhel of Wheat. But the care of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> under whoſe Protection the world then was, ſoon provided a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for that Calamity.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Cretans</hi> had no ſuch help: who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Metellus,</hi> and reduced to the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, rather tormented than quench'd their thirſt with their own and the Urine of their Cattle. For fearing to be overcome, they ſuffer'd that, which the Victors would not have forced them to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Numantines</hi> being beſieged by <hi>Scipio,</hi> when they had conſum'd all other things, at length were conſtrain'd to feed upon Mans-fleſh. So that when their City was taken, there were many found with the joynts and members of the ſlain in their boſomes. But Neceſſity has no excuſe for this; for there was no neceſſity for them to live, to whom it was ſo lawful to dye.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the horrid impiety of the <hi>Calagurritans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the obſtinacy of the former: who to the end they might appear the more faithful to the aſhes of the ſlain <hi>Sertorius,</hi> being beſieg'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> having devoured all other creatures in their City, fell to feaſt

It had bin more proper for ſo great a Captain to have puniſht ſuch an Enemy, than to ſeek for Victory. For Revenge would have purchaſed them more Liberty, than Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory could win them Honour; in compariſon of whom Serpents and wild beaſts were gentle and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful creatures.

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:41263:176"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Which that I may do according to the order which I have propoſed, I will begin with the Father of a certain Souldier, who hearing a falſe report of the death of his Son from the Camp, made other Heirs in his Will, and died. The Youngman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home after the war Was ended, found the dores ſhut againſt him, by the errour of his Father, and the impudence of his Friends. For how could they ſhew themſelves more ſhameleſs than they did? The Souldier had ſpent the flower of his youth in his Countries Service, had undergone moſt dreadful Labours and Dangers, ſhewed the Wounds which he had received in Battle, and only begg'd that lazy Drones, a very burthen to the very City it ſelf, might not poſſeſs his Anceſtors Inheritance. Therefore laying aſide his Armes, he was forced to commence a Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war in the Court of Juſtice. A hard caſe, while he is forc'd to contend for his Fathers eſtate with wicked Heirs before the <hi>Centumviri;</hi> though they could not chooſe but give their Opinions for him, while the Sentence of the Court gave him the day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Marcus Anneius</hi> the Son of <hi>M. Carſeolanus,</hi> a famous <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, adopted by <hi>Sufenas</hi> his Uncle, cancell'd his Fathers Will, who had left him out of it, by the Sentence of the <hi>Centumviri,</hi> before whom he tryed the Cauſe; though <hi>Tullianus,</hi> the familiar Friend of <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who was a witneſs to it, were made Heir. Therefore he had more to do with the power of a perſon potent in Court, than with the aſhes of his Father. Yet though both did what they could to hinder him, he obtain'd his fathers Goods. For <hi>L. Sextilius,</hi> and <hi>P. Popilius,</hi> whom <hi>M. Anncius,</hi> as being his neareſt Relations, had made Heirs of the ſame part which was given to <hi>Tullianus,</hi> durſt not contend by their Otahs with the young man. Though they might have bin ſent for at that time by the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41263:177"/>higheſt Authorities then in being, to have defended the Will. And it was ſome pretence for the Heirs, that <hi>M. Anneius</hi> was tranſlated into the Family of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenas.</hi> But the ſtrong tye of procreation overcame both the Fathers Will, and the Authority of ſo great a Perſonage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>C. Tettius,</hi> an Infant born of <hi>Petronia</hi> the Wife as <hi>Tettius</hi> as long as he liv'd, being diſinherited by his Father, was reſtor'd to his Inheritance by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the divine <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> doing like a Father of his Countrey: In regard that <hi>Tettius</hi> had ſo unjuſtly abrogated the paternal Name, by giving away his eſtate from a Son, ſo legally born to his own Right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Septicia</hi> alſo, the Mother of the <hi>Trachali</hi> of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> being angry with her Sons, out of ſpite when ſhe was now paſt child-bearing married <hi>Publicius</hi> an old man, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he order'd that the Sons ſhould have their Mothers eſtate, and commanded the Husband to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her Dower; becauſe ſhe did not marry out of hopes of having Children. If Juſtice her ſelf had given ſentence in this caſe, could ſhe have pronounc'd a juſter Sentence? Thou deſpiſeſt thoſe whom thou haſt begot; thou marrieſt paſt Child-bearing; thou breakeſt the order of Wills out of a violent humour, and doſt not bluſh to give all thy Patrimony to a perſon, to whoſe feeble body thou haſt proſtituted thy old Age. And therefore, while thou thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haveſt thy ſelf, thou art caſt down to Hell by the voice of heavenly Thunder.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Famous is the Conſtitution of <hi>C. Calpurnius Piſo,</hi> Praetor of the City. For when <hi>Terentius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd before him, together with his eight Sons, whom he had bred up to be men, that one of his Sons
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41263:177"/>whom he had parted with in Adoption, had diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited him; gave him the poſſeſſion of the young mans eſtate, and would not ſuffer the Heirs to go to Law. The Paternal Majeſty of the man mov'd <hi>Calpurnius</hi> doubtleſs, together with the gift of Life, and the benefit of Education: but that which more moved him, was the number of his other Children that ſtood by, ſeeing ſeven Brothers and a Father diſinherited by one Child.</p>

                  <p>HAving contented our ſelves with theſe Examples of cancell'd Wills, let us give a hint upon thoſe that have remain'd confirm'd, when there was cauſe enough for them to have bin cancell'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How publickly and ſcandalouſly was <hi>Tuditanus</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He made his Son Heir by his Will: which <hi>T. Longus</hi> by the Judgment of the <hi>Centumviri</hi> in vain endeavour'd to have diſannull'd, as being next of kin. For the <hi>Centumviri</hi> thought it more proper to conſider what was written in the Will, than who had wrote it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The converſation of <hi>Tuditanus</hi> was Frantick; but <hi>Aebucia,</hi> who was the wife of <hi>L. Menenius Agrippa.</hi> made a Will that was Madneſs it ſelf. For having two Daughters of equal vertue, <hi>Plaetoria</hi> and <hi>Afrania,</hi> through the inclination of her own minde, rather
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41263:178"/>than for any offence or miſcarriage, ſhe only made <hi>Plaetoria</hi> her Heir: and to the Children of <hi>Afrania,</hi> out of her vaſt Patrimony, ſhe left only twenty thouſand pieces of Money. However <hi>Afrania</hi> would not contend by Oath with her Siſter, rather chooſing patiently to honour her Mothers Will, than to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it in Court; ſhewing her ſelf thereby ſo much the more unworthy the Injury done her, by how much the more patiently ſhe bore it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> committed a womaniſh errour, leſs to be admir'd. For he, though there were ſeveral eminent and famous young men, of the ſame name, living in our City at the ſame time, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Claudii,</hi> to whom he was moſt nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, were then very numerous, left <hi>Carinates</hi> onely his Heir; neither did any one attempt to queſtion his Will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Pompeius</hi> alſo <hi>Rheginus,</hi> a <hi>Tramontane,</hi> being by his Brother left out of his Will, and that to prove his Injuſtice, he had in a full Aſſembly of both Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders recited two former Wills made and teſtified in the publick place of Elections, by which this Brother was made Heir of the greateſt part, only there was premis'd to him the ſumm of an hundred and fifty Seſterces; after he had long complain'd to his Friends that ſooth'd his indignation, took a reſolution not to trouble the aſhes of his Brother in a Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature. Yet they, whom he had made his Heirs, were ſo far from being ſo near a kin by the Fathers ſide, that they were not the next to him; but ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and poor. So that the Silence ſeem'd to be wicked, and the Pride contumelious.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Happy in their Impunity, but whether theſe Wills were not worſe in offending, is the Queſtion. <hi>Quintus Caecilius</hi> by the dilig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. Neither was <hi>T.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41263:179"/>of time (if it be of that force which we believe it to be) did Conſcience puniſh that abominable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!

                     <p>NOw that the doubtful motions of Judgments may more eaſily be endured, let us relate for what cauſes they that laboured under Envy, were either acquited or condemned.</p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:41263:180"/>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>M. Horatius</hi> being condemned by <hi>Tullus</hi> the King for having ſlain his Siſter, was acquitted by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the people. The one was incens'd by the Cruelty of the Murther, the other by the reaſon of the fact enclin'd to Mercy: believing the immature love of the Virgin more ſeverely than impiouſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. And thus the brothers arm being ſav'd by ſo ſtout a correction, reap'd as much honour from the blood of his near relation, as from the blood of an enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Before, the <hi>Roman</hi> people ſhewed themſelves fierce preſervers of Chaſtity; afterwards more mild Judges than Juſtice it ſelf required. For when <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Galba</hi> was ſeverely accuſed by <hi>Libo,</hi> a Tribune of the People, for that being a Praetor in <hi>Spain,</hi> he had put to death a great number of the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> contrary to his Faith given them; and that <hi>Cato,</hi> at that time very aged, in an Oration upon publick Record, had made good what the Tribune had done; ſo that the party accuſed had not a word to ſay for his own defence; yet when with tears in his eyes he only recommended to the Aſſembly his little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the young Son of <hi>Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> neerly related to him, he ſo appeas'd the wrath of his Judges, that he, who was but juſt now ready to be condemn'd by the Vote of all, had hardly in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one Vote to his prejudice. Pitie, not Equity, rul'd that Inditement; ſince that Abſolution that could not be granted to Innocency, was given out of reſpect to the Children.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Like to this was that which follows. <hi>Aulus Gabinius,</hi> in the height of Infamy, being by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of <hi>C. Memmius</hi> expos'd to the ſuffrages of the People, ſeem'd to be paſt all hope. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement was full, the Defence weak, and his Judges ſuch as with a precipitate malice deſired his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41263:181"/>The Officers and Impriſonment hovered before his eyes, and yet all vaniſhed away by the interpoſition of propitious Fortune. For <hi>Siſenna,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gabinius,</hi> by an impulſe of conſternation, throwing himſelf a Suppliant at the feet of <hi>Memmius,</hi> beſought there ſome aſſwagement of the Tempeſt, where the whole fury of the Storm firſt aroſe. Whom the Victor beholding with a ſtern countenance, and tearing his Ring from his finger, ſuffer'd for ſome time to lye groveling upon the ground. Which ſad ſpectacle wrought that effect, that <hi>Laelius</hi> the Tribune by a general conſent order'd the priſoner to be ſet at liberty. Teaching us, that no man ought inſolently to abuſe the ſucceſſes of Proſperity, nor over-weakly to be caſt down by Adverſity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Which is made manifeſt by the next Example. <hi>Publius Claudius,</hi> I cannot tell whether to the greater detriment of Religion or his Countrey (in regard he contemn'd the antient Cuſtomes of the one, and loſt a noble Navy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>other) being expos'd to the anger of the People; when it was thought he could no way avoid the puniſhment that he deſerv'd, ſaved himſelf from Condemnation, by the benefit of a ſuddain ſtorm. By which means the Trial being laid aſide, it pleaſed the People never to bring it on again, as if the Gods themſelves had forbid it. Thus was he ſaved by a Land-ſtorm, whom a Sea-tempeſt had like to have brought to condemnation.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By the ſame ſort of aſſiſtance the Chaſtity of <hi>Tuccia,</hi> a <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgin, and accus'd of Inceſt, eſcaped out of a black cloud of Infamy. Who truſting to the ſincerity of her Innocency, ventur'd the hope of her ſafety upon a doubtful argument. For, ſnatching up a ſieve, Veſta, ſaid ſhe, <hi>If I have always attended thy Rites with clean and chaſt hands, grant that I may take up water out of</hi> Tiber <hi>in this, and carry it
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41263:181"/>to thy Temple.</hi> Nature gave way to the raſh and bold Imprecation of the Prieſteſs.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Lucius Piſo</hi> alſo being accuſed by <hi>Claudius Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> for having done great and intolerable injuries to the <hi>Roman</hi> Allies, by a luckly chance eſcaped the fear of an unqueſtioned ruine: For at the ſame time that they were about to give ſevere Judgment againſt him, there fell a ſudden ſhower, which filled his mouth full of durt, as he lay proſtrate at the feet of his Judges. Which Spectacle changed the whole Trial from Severity into Pity and Clemency. For they believ'd he had given full ſatisfaction to their Allies, by being compell's to proſtate himſelf ſo ſubmiſſively, and riſe again with ſo much deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I will adde two that eſcaped by their Accuſers own fault. <hi>Quintus Flavius</hi> the Augur was accuſed by <hi>Valerius</hi> the Aedil, and proved guilty to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and being condemn'd by the Votes of fourteen Tribes, cryed out he was innocently condemn'd. To whom <hi>Valerius</hi> made anſwer with a loud voice, that he car'd not whether he were put to death Guilty or Innocent, ſo he were put to death. Which violent ſpeech brought over the reſt of the Tribes to his Adverſaries ſide. He had caſt his enemy: when he certainly thought him ruin'd, he reſtor'd him; and loſt the victory, even in the victory it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>C. Coſconius</hi> found guilty by the <hi>Servilian</hi> Law, and for many evident and notorious crimes condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was ſav'd by one Verſe recited in the Seſſions-Houſe by <hi>Valerius Valentinus</hi> his Adverſary, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying by a Poetical Joke, that he had defil'd a noble Youth and a free Virgin. For they thought it unjuſt that he ſhould go away Victor, who rather deſerv'd to give the Palm from himſelf, than to take it from another. Therefore was <hi>Valerius</hi> rather condemn'd
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41263:182"/>by the Abſolution of <hi>Coſconius,</hi> than <hi>Coſconius</hi> freed at his Trial.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I will touch upon thoſe alſo whoſe Crimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ruin'd all their hopes, have been pardon'd for the renown of their Relations. <hi>A. Attilius Calati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being condemn'd for having betrayed the Town of <hi>Sora,</hi> and a perſon otherwiſe infamous, only a few words of <hi>Q. Maximus,</hi> his Father-in-law, ſav'd from the threatning danger: wherein he affirmed, that if he found him guilty of that crime, he would break oft his affinity. Preſently the People yielded up their own to the judgment of one man; believing it an unworthy thing, not to believe his Teſtimony, whom they had entruſted in the greateſt Dangers of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>M. Aemilius Scaurus</hi> alſo guilty of Bribery, made ſo lame and pitiful defence at his Trial, that his Accuſer ſaid openly, that he ſhould have liberty to name an hundred and twenty witneſſes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that he would be content to have the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner acquitted, if he could produce ſo many in the Province, from whom he had never taken any thing. Yet, though he could not make uſe of ſo fair a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was freed for the ſake of his Nobility, and the freſh memory of his Father.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But as the Fame of Great men has prevailed to protect the Guilty, ſo has it as little avail'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them: rather it has bin a ſafeguard to them in the height of Proſecution. <hi>P. Scipio Aemilianus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>L. Cotta</hi> to the Praetor; whoſe cauſe, though it were full of deep crimes, was ſeven times delayed, and the eighth judgment acquitted him. For thoſe wiſe men were loath it ſhould be thought that his Condemnation had bin, becauſe his Accuſer was ſo great a perſon. And therefore I believe they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd thus amongſt themſelves: We muſt not admit
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41263:182"/>him that ſeeks the life of another, to bring Triumphs, Trophies and Spoils to the ſeat of Judgment: Let him be terrible to his Enemy; but let not a Citizen, truſting to his high Merits and great Honour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a Citizen.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Not more eager were thoſe Judges againſt a moſt noble Accuſer, than theſe were mild toward a Criminal of a far lower degree. <hi>Callidius</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> being taken by night in the Husbands Bed-chamber, being brought to anſwer for the Adultery, he buoyed himſelf up among the greateſt and moſt violent waves of Infamy, ſwimming like corn in a Shipwrack, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon a very ſlight kind of defence. For he pleaded, that he was carried thither, for the Love of a Servant-boy. The place was ſuſpected, the time ſuſpitious, the Miſtreſs of the houſe was ſuſpected, and his Youth ſuſpected: But the confeſſion of a more intemperate Luſt, freed him from the Crime of Adultery.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The next is an example of more concernment. When the two Brothers of <hi>Cloelius</hi> were brought to anſwer for Patricide, whoſe Father was kill'd in his bed, while the Sons lay aſleep in the ſame Chamber, and neither Servant nor Freed-man could be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom to faſten the ſuſpicion of the Murther: They were both acquitted, only for this reaſon, that it was made appear to the Judges, that they were both found faſt aſleep with the door open.

                     <p n="1">1. Now we will briefly touch upon thoſe, to whom
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41263:183"/>things beſide the queſtion did more harm, than their own Innocency did good. <hi>L. Scipio,</hi> after a moſt noble Triumph over King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was condemned for taking Money of him. Not that I think he was brib'd to remove beyond the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> him that was lately Lord of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and juſt going to lay his victorious hands upon <hi>Europe.</hi> But being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man of a moſt upright life, and free far enough from any ſuch ſuſpicion, he could not reſiſt that envy that haunted the two famous Sirnames of the two Brothers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Scipio</hi> was a perſon of high ſplendour. But <hi>Decianus,</hi> a perſon of unſpotted Integrity, was ruin'd by his own tongue. For when he accuſed <hi>P. Furius,</hi> a man of a lewd life, becauſe that in ſome part of his Declamation he ventured to complain of the Death of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> did not only not condemn the Guilty, but ſuffered the Puniſhment appointed for him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame caſe overthrew <hi>C. Titius.</hi> He was innocent, and in favour with the People for the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Law. But becauſe he had the ſtatue of <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> in his houſe, the whole College of Magiſtrates with one general conſent ruined him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may to theſe adde <hi>Claudia,</hi> whom though innocent of a crime, an impious Imprecation ruined. For being crowded by the multitude, as ſhe returned home from the Playes, ſhe wiſhed that her Brother, by whom we had the greateſt loſs of our Naval Forces, were alive again, that being made often Conſul, he might by his ill conduct rid the City of the peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We may paſs to thoſe whom the violence of Condemnation ſnatched away for flight cauſes. <hi>M. Mulvius, Cn. Lellius, L. Sextilius</hi> Triumvirs, becauſe they did not come ſo quickly, as they ought, to quench a Fire that happend in the <hi>Holy way,</hi> being cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41263:183"/>the People at a prefixed day by the Tribune, were condemned.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Publius Villius</hi> alſo, Nocturnal Triumvir, being accuſed by <hi>Aquilius</hi> the Tribune, fell by the Sentence of the People, becauſe he was negligent in going his watch.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Very ſevere was that Sentence of the People, when they deeply fin'd <hi>M. Aemilius Porcina,</hi> being accuſed by <hi>L. Caſſius,</hi> for having built his Houſe in the Village of <hi>Alſium</hi> a little too high.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Nor is that Condemnation to be ſuppreſt of one, who being over-fond of his little Boy, and being by him deſir'd to buy him ſome Chitterlings for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; becauſe there were none to be got in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, kill'd a Plough-Ox, to ſatisfie the Boys deſire.

                     <p n="1">1. Now to ſay ſomething of thoſe, that being queſtioned for their Lives, were neither quitted nor condemned. There was a Woman brought before <hi>Popilius Lenas</hi> the Praetor, for having beaten her Mother to Death with a Club. But the Praetor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged nothing againſt her, neither one way nor other. For it was plain, that ſhe did it to revenge the death of her Children, whom the Grand-mother, angry with her Daughter, had poyſoned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſame demur made <hi>Dolabella</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Aſia.</hi> A woman of <hi>Smyrna</hi> killed her Husband and her Son, underſtanding that they had killed another Son of hers, a hopeful young man, which ſhe had by a former Husband. <hi>Dolabella</hi> would not take cognizance of the Cauſe, but ſent it to be determined by the <hi>Areopagi</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Unwilling to ſet a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Claudius Centumalus</hi> being commanded by the Augurs to pull down ſome of the height of his Houſe, which he had built upon the <hi>Coelian</hi> Mount, becauſe it hindered them from obſerving their Auguries from the Tower, ſold it to <hi>Calpurnius Lanatius,</hi> concealing the command of the Augurs. By whom <hi>Calpurnius</hi> being compelled to pluck down his Houſe, brought <hi>Marc. Porcius Cato,</hi> father of the famous <hi>Cato,</hi> to <hi>Claudius</hi> as an Arbitrator, and the form of Writing, <hi>Whatever he ought to give him, or do in good Equity.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:41263:184"/>Cato,</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Claudius</hi> had for the nonce ſuppreſt the Augurs Edict, preſently condemned him to <hi>Calpurnius;</hi> with all the Juſtice in the world. For they that ſell according to Conſcience and Equity, ought neither to enhance the hopes of the Bargain, nor conceal the Inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have recited a Judgment famous in thoſe times: Yet what I am about to relate, is not quite buried in ſilence. <hi>C. Viſellius Varro</hi> being taken with a great fit of Sickneſs, ſuffered a Judgment of three thouſand pieces of Money, as borrowed of <hi>Otacilia Laterenſis,</hi> with whom he had lived as her Gallant: With this deſigne, that if he died, ſhe might claim that ſum of the Heirs; colouring the Liberality of his Luſt, under the title of a Debt. After that, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellius,</hi> contrary to <hi>Otacilia's</hi> wiſhes, recovers. Who offended that ſhe had loſt her prey by his recovery, from a cloſe Friend began to act like an open Uſurer, challenging the Money, which as ſhameleſly as vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe gap'd for by a void contract. Which <hi>Aquillius,</hi> a man of great authority and knowledge in the Civil Law, being choſen to be Judge of, conſulting with the Principal Men of the City, by his Prudence and good Conſcience foyled the woman. And if by the ſame form <hi>Varro</hi> might have been condemned, and the adverſary abſolved, no queſtion but he would have willingly puniſh'd his fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l and unwarrantable folly. Now he ſtifled the calumny of a private Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and left the crime of Adultery to publick Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Much more ſtoutly and with a ſouldierlike Gallantry did <hi>Marius</hi> behave himſelf in a Judgment of the ſame nature. For when <hi>T. Titinius</hi> or <hi>Minturnum</hi> married <hi>Fannia</hi> his wiſe, becauſe he knew her to be unchaſt, and having divorc'd her for the ſame crime, would have kept her Dower: he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing choſen Judge, and having examined the buſineſs, took <hi>Titinius</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:41263:185"/>aſide, and perſwaded him to proceed no farther, but to return the woman her Dower; but finding that all his perſwaſions were in vain, and being forced to pronounce Sentence, he fin'd the woman for Adultery a Seſterce, and <hi>Titinius</hi> the whole ſumm of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Telling them, that therefore he had obſerved that method of judgment, becauſe it ſeemd to him apparent, that he had married <hi>Fannia</hi> whom he knew to be a lewd woman, that he might cheat her of her eſtate. This <hi>Fannia</hi> was ſhe, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when <hi>Marius</hi> was proclaimed an Enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into her houſe at <hi>Minturnum,</hi> all bedaubed with mud and durt, and aſſiſted him what lay in her power; remembring that he had adjudged her for Unchaſtity, out of his rigorous manner of life, but that he had ſaved her Dower, out of his Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Judgment was alſo much talked of, by which a certain perſon was condemned for theft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having borrowed a Horſe to carry him to <hi>Aricia,</hi> he rode him to the furthermoſt cliff of that City, What can we do here but praiſe the Modeſty of that Age, wherein ſuch minute exceſſes from Honeſty were puniſhed?</p>

                  <p>WHerefore do I delay to commemorate the force of Induſtry? By whoſe active ſpirit the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends of Warfare are corroboraetd, and the glory of the Forum is enflamed; all Studies are cheriſhed in her faithful breaſt: Whatever is performed by the Hand, by the Minde, by the Tongue, by her is added to the heap of applauſe; which being an admirable vertue, ſtrengthens her ſelf yet more by her own Conſtancy.</p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:41263:189"/>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Cato</hi> in the fourſcore and ſixth year of his age, while he perſiſts with a youthful vigour in defending the Commonwealth, accuſed of a Capital Crime by his Enemies, pleaded his own Cauſe: Yet no man ever obſerved ſo large a Memory, a greater ſtrength of Body, or leſs heſitation of Speech. Becauſe he kept all thoſe things in equal condition, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſed by Induſtry. And at the very conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his laborious life, he oppoſed his own moſt eloquent Defence to the Accuſation of <hi>Galba</hi> touching <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame perſon deſired to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: How late, we may thence gueſs, in that he was an old man before he learnt to read <hi>Latine.</hi> But when he had won great Honour by his Eloquence, he did it to make himſelf skilful in the Civil Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whoſe wonderful Offspring, nearer to our age, <hi>Cato</hi> alſo, burn't with ſuch a deſire of learning, that in the very Court it ſelf, before the Senate fill'd, he would be reading <hi>Greeks</hi> Books. By which Induſtry he ſhewed that ſome want time, others have more than they need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> an Example of Humane Life, and one that might be truly call'd, <hi>A ſpace of years;</hi> not ſo much for his years, which were equal to an Age of Time, as for the vivacity of his Style. For in the ſame Bed his Breath, and the courſe of his egregious Works expired.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Livius Druſus,</hi> man of the ſame perſeverance, who defective in vigour of Age and Eye-ſight, moſt bountifully interpreted the Civil Law to the People, and compoſed moſt profitable Monuments for them that deſire to learn if. For though Nature might make him old, and Fortune blind, yet neither could prevent him from being vigorous and quick-ſighted in minde.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:41263:189"/>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>Paulus</hi> the Senator, and <hi>Pontius Lupus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, famous Pleaders in their times, having both loſt their ſight, with the ſame Induſtry conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at the Bar. Therefore were they alſo more frequently heard, amid the concourſes of ſome that were delighted with their Wit, and of others that admir'd their Conſtancy. For they that are diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuch Misfortunes, generally deſire diſmiſſion, adding voluntary to fortuitous darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now <hi>P. Craſſus,</hi> when he came Conſul into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> againſt King <hi>Ariſtonicus,</hi> with ſo much care he comprehended in his minde the knowledge of the <hi>Greeks</hi> tongue, that he underſtood it, though divided into five Dialects, in all its parts and quantities. Which mightily won him the love of the Allies, while he anſwered every one in the Language wherein they made their requeſts before his Tribunal.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let not <hi>Roſcius</hi> be left out, a notable Example of Theatrical Induſtry, who never expoſed to the People any other Action or Geſture, but what he had ſtudied before at his own houſe. Therefore did not the Art of Playing make <hi>Roſcius</hi> eſteemed, but <hi>Roſcius</hi> made the Art of Playing eſteemed; whereby he obtained not onely the favour of the people, but the familiarity of Princes. Theſe are the rewards of an intent, anxious, and never-ceaſing Study: For which reaſon the perſon of a Player is not impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſerted among the praiſes of ſo many great men.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Induſtry alſo, becauſe it was very advantageous to ours, ought to receive the fruit which it deſerves from the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> upon the mentioning of whoſe name ariſes in the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:41263:190"/>thoughts of the hearers the perfection of the greateſt Eloquence, when in his youth he could not pronounce the firſt Letter of the Art which he ſo much affected, with ſo much labour vanquiſhed the defect: of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, that no man ever pronounced it naturally more freely. Then again, having a ſhrill ſqueaking Voice, harſh to the ear, he brought it at length to a grave and acceptable Tone. Then being but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he borrowed from labour and practice, that ſtrength of Body which nature had denied him. For he comprehended ſeveral Sentences in one breath, and pronounced them walking up hill with a ſwift pace. And ſtanding upon the Sea-ſide, made his Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the roaring of the Waves, that he might enure his ears with patience to the clamours and noiſes of tumultuous Aſſemblies. He is reported alſo to have accuſtomed himſelf to ſpeak much and long with ſtones held in his mouth, that he might ſpeak with more freedom when it was empty. He warred againſt Nature, and came off Victor; with a moſt obſtinate ſtrength of minde overcoming her malignity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that we may aſcend to a more antient act of Induſtry, <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> a moſt perfect work of wiſdome from his Childhood, and inflamed with a deſire of underſtanding all Honeſty and Vertue, went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where being accuſtomed to the language, he ſearch'd the Commentaries of all the antient Prieſts, and brought away the Obſervations of innumerable Ages. Then travelling into <hi>Perſia,</hi> he delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to be taught by the exact prudence of the <hi>Magi:</hi> From whom he treaſur'd up in his docible minde the Motions of the Stars; their Courſes, their Effects, Properties, and Force, being courteouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him. From thence he viſited <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon,</hi> into whoſe Laws and Manners having made inſpection, he deſcended to the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:41263:190"/>where when, to the admiration of all <hi>Greece,</hi> he had given evident demonſtration of his multiplied know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, being ask'd by what Title he went by, he made anſwer, that he was not <hi>Wiſe,</hi> (for that title belong'd only to the ſeven moſt excellent men) but a <hi>Lover of Wiſdome.</hi> He alſo travelled into part of <hi>Italy,</hi> then called the bigger <hi>Graecia,</hi> in the chiefeſt and richeſt Cities whereof he ſhewed the effects of his Studies. Whoſe burning Funeral-Pile <hi>Metapontus</hi> beheld with eyes full of veneration: A Town more famous for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Tomb, than the monument of its own aſhes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Plato</hi> having <hi>Athens</hi> for his place of Nativity, and <hi>Socrates</hi> for his Maſter, both place and man fertil in Learning; fraught alſo himſelf with a celeſtial abundance of Wit, when he was accounted the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of all Mortals, to that degree, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould deſcend from Heaven, he could not make uſe of a more elegant or happier Eloquence; yet for all this he travell'd to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he learnt from the Prieſts of that Nation, the manifold ſecrets of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi> and the reaſon of their Celeſtial Obſervations. And at the ſame time that the ſtudious Gentlemen of <hi>Athens</hi> ſought for <hi>Plato,</hi> whom every one ſtrove to have his Tutor, he by viſiting the riddle-like Banks of <hi>Nile,</hi> and vaſt Regions, extended Barbariſme, and the winding Canals of a ſtrange Countrey, of an Ancient Maſter became a Scholar. No wonder then that he travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> there from <hi>Archytas</hi> of <hi>Tarentum, Timaeus, Arion</hi> and <hi>Caetus</hi> of <hi>Locri,</hi> to learn the precepts of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> For ſo great a plenty, ſo great an abundance of Learning was every where to be collected, that it might eaſily be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from one place to another, through the whole world. He had alſo under his head at above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41263:191"/>years of age, when he lay a dying, the jeaſts of <hi>Sophron.</hi> So that the laſt hour of his Life was not free from the exerciſe of Study.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But <hi>Democritus,</hi> for all his vaſt wealth, which was ſo great, that his Father could have given a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to the Army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that his minde might be more free for the ſtudy of Letters, keeping a ſmall pittance to himſelf, gave all the reſt to his Countrey. Then abiding at <hi>Athens</hi> for ſeveral years, ſpending all his time in gaining and practiſing learning, he liv'd unknown in the City, as he teſtifies in a certain Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. I am in a maze at ſo much Induſtry, and therefore muſt go on.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Carneades</hi> was a laborious and diuturnal Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Wiſdome's: For after the expiration of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, he made one end of Living and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing. He had ſo addicted himſelf to the works of Learning, that when he ſate down to eat, buſie in his thoughts, he would forget to reach his meat. But <hi>Meliſſa,</hi> whom he kept as a Wife, dutiful to ſupply his hunger, never went to interrupt him, but fed him. So that he lived only in his Soul, which was encompaſs'd with a ſuperfluous body. Being to diſpute with <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> he purged his body before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with Hellebore, to explain his own minde more attentively, and refel his adverſary more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Which Potions he made afterwards to be coveted on purpoſe by ſuch as were covetous of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. What can we think was the zeal of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> for Learning? Who returning home after a long Travel, and ſeeing his eſtate lye untill'd and waſte; <hi>I had not been ſafe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>had not theſe decayed.</hi> An expreſſion becoming far-fetch'd Wiſdome. For had he labour'd more in the manuring his Lands than his Minde, he had remained Maſter of his family at
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41263:191"/>home, but had not returned into his Country the great <hi>Anaxagoras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. I might ſay that the Induſtry of <hi>Archimedes</hi> was very profitable, but that it gave him life, and took it from him again. For when <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was taken <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was ſenſible that his Victory was much delayed by his Engines, yet infinitely taken with the Prudence of the perſon, he commanded the Souldiers to ſpare his Life; aſſuming perhaps almoſt as much glory in ſaving <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as in deſtroying <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> But while <hi>Archimedes</hi> was making Figures with his minde and eyes fixed upon the ground, a Souldier, that was broken into his houſe to plunder, with his drawn Sword asked him who he was. The Philoſopher was ſo intent, that he return'd him no direct Anſwer, but parting the duſt with his finger, <hi>Have a care,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>of ſpoyling this Circle.</hi> Thereupon, as one that ſlighted the Victor of the Empire, the Souldier cut off his Head, and blended his blood with the Lineaments of his Art. Thus the ſame Study gave him his Life, and deprived him of it again.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Moſt certain it is that <hi>Socrates,</hi> when he was ſtricken in years, began to learn Muſick; believing it better to learn that Art, late than never. How little an acceſſion of knowledge was that to <hi>Socrates?</hi> Yet the obſtinate Induſtry of the perſon, to ſo much wealth and treaſure of Learning, would alſo adde the profitable Elements of Muſick. Thus while he thought himſelf poor lo learn, he made himſelf rich to teach.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And that we may reduce the Examples of a long and ſucceſsful Induſtry to one head; <hi>Iſocrates</hi> compos'd that moſt noble Book, entitled <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when he was fourſcore and four years of Age, yet a work full of life and ſpirit. By which it appears, that the members of learned men growing old, yet
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:41263:192"/>their Minds, by the benefit of Induſtry, retain the full vigour of Youth. Nor did he end his days, till he had five years enjoyed the fruit of the admiration of his work.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Leſſer bounds terminated the life of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> yet was he not ſhort-liv'd; for he left behind him the thirty ninth Book of his <hi>Logicks,</hi> a book of exact nicety, begun in the Eightieth Year of his Age. Whoſe Study in delivering the monuments of his Wit, took up ſo much time and labour, that a longer life would be requiſite to underſtand the depth of his writings.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Thee alſo, <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> ſo induſtrious in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and ſo laboriouſly delivering Wiſdome, the Deity of Induſtry could not but admire; when ſhe beheld thee in thy youth, maintaining thy ſelf by carrying water in the Night, in the Day a diligent hearer of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> and till the Hundredth year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one, with attentive care inſtructing thy Diſciples. With a double labour thou haſt taken up the ſpace of one Age, making it uncertain, whether thou wert a better Scholar or a Maſter.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Sopholces</hi> had alſo a glorious combat with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as liberal of his wonderful Works, as ſhe was liberal in giving him long Time to compoſe them. For he lived near an Hundred years, his <hi>Oedipus Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> being written by him juſt before his death. By which one Tragedy he won the honour from all the Poets in that way: Which <hi>Jophon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> would not have concealed from Poſterity, and therefore cauſed it to be inſcribed upon his Fathers Tomb.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Simonides</hi> the Poet at Fourſcore years of Age boaſts himſelf, that he taught Verſes, and contended for the prize at thoſe years. Nor was it but reaſon that he ſhould long enjoy the fruit of his own Wit,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:41263:192"/>who was himſelf to communicate them for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of eternity.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Now for <hi>Solon,</hi> how induſtrious he was, he has declared in his Verſes: Wherein he ſignifies, that he grew old, always learning ſomething; and the laſt day of his life confirmed it. For as his Friends were ſitting by him, and diſcourſing among themſelves upon ſome ſubject or other, he liſted up his head, then juſt about to bow to fate; and being asked why he did ſo; <hi>That when I underſtand,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what it is you are diſputing upon, I may dye.</hi> Certainly Sloath had bin baniſhed from among mankinde, if all men ſhould come into the world with the ſame Spirit that <hi>Solon</hi> le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="15">15.

                  <p>EAſe, becauſe it ſeems to be contrary to Induſtry, but chiefly to Labour, ought to be briefly touch'd upon: Not that which extinguiſhes, but which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates Vertue.

For he by an Oration reduc'd the people, glorying in a new and unwonted freedome, to their obedience to the Senate, brought them to take ſober counſels, and joyn'd the City to the City. Therefore to eloquent words, Wrath, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation and Armes gave way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which alſo reſtrain'd the Swords of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> raging with an impetuous deſire of ſhedding Civil blood.

                  <p>BUt the Ornaments of Eloquence conſiſt in apt Motion of the Body, and due Pronuntiation: Wherewith when ſhe has furniſhed her ſelf, ſhe aſſails men three ways; by invading their Mindes, and delivering up the ears of the one and the eyes of the other to over-perſuaſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But to make this good in famous men; <hi>C. Gracchus,</hi> more happy in his Eloquence than his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, becauſe he ſtrove with a turbulent Wit rather to diſturb than defend the Commonwealth, as often as he ſpoke to the People, had a Servant that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Muſic</hi> behinde him, who with an Ivory Pipe regulated the tone of his Voice, raiſing the note when it was too low, and pitching it lower when it was too high and eager: Becauſe heat and violence of action, did not ſuffer him to be a true Judge of the equality.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Quintus Hortenſius</hi> thinking there was very much to be aſcribed to a decent and comly motion of the Body, ſpent more time in practiſing that, than in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:41263:195"/>ſtudying for Eloquence. So that it was hard to know, whether the Concourſe were greater to hear or ſee him: So mutually did his Aſpect ſerve his words, and his words his Aſpect. And therefore it is certain, that <hi>Roſcius</hi> and <hi>Aeſopus,</hi> the moſt skilful Actors in the world, would be always in Court when <hi>Hortenſius</hi> pleaded, to carry away his poſtures to the Stage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now as for <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> he has himſelf declar'd, how great a value he ſet upon both theſe things, of which we have diſcours'd, in his Oration for <hi>Gallius,</hi> reproaching <hi>Callidius</hi> the Accuſer, that when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that he would prove by Witneſſes, Writings, and Examinations, that the Party accus'd had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared poyſon for him, he did it with a ſmooth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, a faint Voice, and a calm manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby he detected as well the fault of the Orator, as the argument of his weak cauſe, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus; <hi>Couldſt thou do thus,</hi> M. Calidus, <hi>unleſs thou didſt but counterfeit?</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. Conſentaneous to this was the judgment of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who being ask'd what was the moſt efficacious part that belong'd to ſpeaking, anſwered, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Therefore was it rightly ſaid of <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> who leaving <hi>Athens</hi> becauſe of the Judicial Ignominy put upon him, and going to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> when he had there repeated his own Oration againſt <hi>Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and the Oration of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> for him, with a loud and pleaſing voice, and that all admir'd the Eloquence of both, but ſomewhat more that of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes;

                  <p n="1">1. The great care of <hi>Sulpitius Gallus</hi> to furniſh
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41263:196"/>himſelf with all manner of Learning, was very profitable to the Commonwealth. For being Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General to <hi>L.

Whoſe Wife <hi>Praxiteles</hi> place in Marble in the Temple of the <hi>Gnidians,</hi> as it were breathing, by reaſon of the Workmanſhip, not ſafe from the luſtful embraces of <hi>Macareus</hi> the <hi>Perinthian.</hi> Which renders the errour of a Horſe more excuſable, who ſeeing the Picture of a Mare, neigh'd after it: and the barking of Dogs, at the ſight of a Dog painted; and the Bull mov'd to Luſt, upon ſight of the brazen Cow in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> caſt to the Life. For why ſhould we wonder to ſee irrational Creatures deceived by Art, when we finde a ſacrilegious Deſire in Man rais'd up at the ſight of a dumb ſtone?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But Nature as ſhe ſuffers Art ſometimes to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her works, ſo ſometimes ſhe diſmiſſes it, quite tir'd with labour in vain; which the hands of the famous Artiſt <hi>Euphranor</hi> experimented: For when he painted twelve Gods at <hi>Athens,</hi> he finiſhed the Picture of <hi>Neptune</hi> with the moſt Majeſtick Colours he could invent, intending yet to have outdone that in the Picture of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But all his Invention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhauſted in the former work, his laſt endeavours could not come near his expectation.</p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:41263:197"/>
                     <p n="6">6. What ſhall we ſay of that other famous Painter, who repreſenting the doleful Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> when he had placed about the Altar <hi>Calchas</hi> ſad, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſorrowful, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> lamenting, by wrapping up of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s face did he not confeſs, that the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the height of grief could not be expreſt by Art? Therefore his Picture moiſten'd with the tears of the Southſayer, her Friends and Brother, he left it to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to judge of the Father's Grief.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And that I may adde one Example of the ſame Art; A famous Painter had painted a Horſe, new coming from being hard exercis'd, ſo rarely, that all that could be ſaid was, that the Horſe was not alive. But when he came to adde the froath to his Noſtrils, ſo great an Artiſt ſpent many days without any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to himſelf. At length, vexed to ſee himſelf diſappointed, he took up a Spunge that lay next him bedaub'd with all ſorts of Colours, and went about to rub out his own work. But Fortune directing his hand firſt to the Noſtrils of the Horſe, the Spunge did that by chance, which all his Art could not effect. So that what his own Shadows could not, Chance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>

                  <p>LEt Old Age, prolonged to the utmoſt, have a place in this work, among the Examples of Induſtry, but with a particular Title and Chapter. That we may not ſeem to have forgotten thoſe, to whom the Gods were principally indulgent. Inſiſting upon which, every one may make himſelf more happy in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:41263:199"/>reſpect of his antient felicity; and may affirm the happineſs of our age, than which none was ever more happy, by prolonging the ſafety of a wiſe and great Prince, to the longeſt bounds of humane life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>M. Valerius Corvus</hi> liv'd out his hundredth year; between whoſe firſt and ſixth Conſulſhip were forty ſix years compleat. Nor did his full ſtrength of body not only not fail him, in the higheſt employments of the Commonwealth, but alſo for the manuring his Land: a deſireable Example of a Commonwealths man, and a Maſter of a Family.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which ſpace of years <hi>Metellus</hi> equall'd: And the fourth year after his Conſular Government, being created <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> when he was very old, he govern'd the Ceremonies of Religion two and twenty years, his tongue never tripping in pronouncing the Votes, nor his hand trembling in preparing the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus</hi> threeſcore and two years held the Prieſthood of the Augurſhip, having obtain'd it when he was a ſtrong man. Which two times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added together, will eaſily compleat the age of an hundred years.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>M.

                  <p n="5">5. I might conclude the life of <hi>Appius</hi> with his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, becauſe he lived long after he was blind; but that he had five Sons and five Daughters, and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Clients in his Protection, and in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition moſt ſtoutly govern'd the Commonwealth. At length weary with living, he caus'd himſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Senate-houſe in a Litter, to hinder peace
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:41263:199"/>from being made with <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> upon diſhonourable Conditions. Can this man be thought blinde, by whom his Countrey purely diſcerning that which was honourable, was compell'd to open its eyes?</p>

                     <p n="1">1. I will adde to theſe, two Kings, whoſe long life was very advantageous to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> The King of <hi>Sicily, Hiero,</hi> numbred ninety years. <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> reigning threeſcore years, was ſuperiour to all men in vigour of age. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book of <hi>Old Age,</hi> reports of him, that no ſhower or cold could compel him to cover his head. He was wont alſo to keep his ſtation for ſeveral hours, and would never ſtir from hard labour, till he had tired the young men: And if it were requiſite for him to do any thing ſitting, he would oft-times for a whole day ſit in the ſame poſture, without moving his body for eaſe, either one way or other. When he led his Army a Horſeback by day, he never alighted that night; omitting none of thoſe labours, which youth is wont to endure, when he was of that extream age. And ſo vigorous he was in reference to Women, that he begat his Son <hi>Methymnatus,</hi> when he was four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſix years of age. The Countrey alſo which he found untill'd, by perpetual culture he left very fruitful.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Gorgias</hi> alſo of <hi>Leontium,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> and ſeveral other great men, by his own ſaying was
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41263:200"/>moſt happy. For when he had lived an hundred and ſeven years, being asked why he would live ſo long: <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ayle nothing to accuſe my Old Age.</hi> What could be longer or more happy than ſuch a tract of Life? For being entered into the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of years, he neither found any cauſe of complaint in it, nor left any behinde him of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Xenophilus</hi> of <hi>Chaleis</hi> wanted two of his years, yet not inferiour in enjoyment of health. For as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoxenus</hi> the Muſician ſaies of him, Free from all the inconventencies of old Age, he died in the full ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of conſummate Learning.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Arganthonius</hi> the <hi>Gaditane</hi> reigned ſo long, as would have ſufficed another to live. For he govern'd his Kingdom fourſcore years, being forty years of age before he came to the Throne: For which there are moſt certain and credible Authors. <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> not the leaſt part of <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, in the third Book of his Hiſtory, relates him to have lived an hundred and twenty years: No mean example of ſinewy vigour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> render the long life of this King leſs admirable; whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded an hundred and twenty years: and the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> of whom <hi>Cteſias</hi> delivers the ſame. And <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides</hi> the <hi>Gnoſſian,</hi> whom <hi>Theopompus</hi> reports to have lived an hundred fifty and ſeven years.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Hellanicus</hi> alſo avers, that certain of the <hi>Epii,</hi> who were a people of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> lived two hundred years; with whom <hi>Damaſthes</hi> agrees, adding this moreover, that one <hi>Litorius</hi> among them, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great ſtrength and ſtature, compleated three hundred years.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Alexander,</hi> in his Volume of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Tract, affirms, that one <hi>Dantho</hi> lived full out five hundred years, without the leaſt complaint of Age. But
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:41263:200"/>much more liberal is <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who gives to the King of the <hi>Lachnii</hi> eight hundred years of Life. And that his Father might not take it ill, he allows him ſix hundred.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The ſame was the honorable minde of <hi>D.

And though he ſtoopt to a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Art, yet he would not have his labours oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, how mean ſoever: they were following the example of <hi>Phidias,</hi> who included his own face upon the Shield of <hi>Minerva,</hi> in ſuch manner, that if it were pull'd away, the whole work would be quite ſpoiled.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. But better had he done to have imitated <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles,</hi> had he bin taken with forraign Examples; who is reported to have bin ſo prick'd with the ſting of Honour, that he could not ſleep a nights; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ask'd, what he did abroad at that time of the night, made anſwer, <hi>That he could not ſleep for the Trophies of</hi> Miltiades. For <hi>Marathon</hi> rous'd up his noble Minde to ennoble <hi>Artemiſium</hi> and <hi>Salamis</hi> with Naval Glory. The ſame perſon going to the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and being ask'd whoſe voice was moſt pleaſing to his ears, made anſwer, <hi>His that ſhall ſing my acts the beſt and loudeſt.</hi> He added as it were an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſweetneſs to Honour it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Breaſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> was inſatiable of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; who when <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> his Companion, by the authority of <hi>Democritus,</hi> affirm'd, that there were innumerable worlds; <hi>How miſerable then,</hi> ſaid he,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:41263:202"/>
                        <hi>am I, that have not conquered one!</hi> Man thought his Honour too much confin'd, that had not all that which ſuffices for the Habitation of the Gods.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I will adde the thirſt of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> after Honour, as great as that of a King and a young man. For he had given certain Books of Oratory to <hi>Theodectes</hi> his Diſciple, to put forth in his own name: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards vex'd that he had let go the Title to another, inſiſting upon ſome things in his own Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, he addes, that he had diſcourſed more plainly of them in the Books of <hi>Theodectes.</hi> Did not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of ſo great and ſo diffuſive a Science withhold me, I would ſay, he was a Philoſopher, whoſe great parts ought to have been delivered to a Philoſopher of a nobler Soul. But Honour is not contemn'd by thoſe that deſire to introduce the Contempt of it. For to thoſe very Volumes they diligently ſet their Names, that what they take away by Profeſſion, they may attain by Uſurpation of Memory. But this diſſimulation of theirs, whatever it be, is more to be endur'd than the purpoſe of thoſe, who while they labour for eternal Memories, ſtrive to become famous by wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Among which I know not whether <hi>Pauſanias</hi> may not be firſt mentioned; for when he had ask'd <hi>Hermocrates</hi> how he might ſuddenly become famous, and that the other had anſwered, By killing ſome great perſon, preſently went and ſlew <hi>Philip.</hi> And indeed what be coveted he had; for he render'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as infamouſly famous for the Murther, as <hi>Philip</hi> was eminent for his Vertue to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But this deſire of Glory was ſacrilegious. For there was one found out, who would ſet on fire the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that by the deſtruction of that lovely Pile, his name might be known to the whole world. Which fury of his minde he diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:41263:202"/>upon the Rack. Yet the <hi>Epheſians</hi> had taken care, by a Decree, to aboliſh the memory of the worſt of men, had not the eloquent Wit of <hi>Theopompus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the fact in his Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>WHat Magnificent things have deſervedly befaln every one, being put to publick view, will afford delight to ingenious minds: becauſe the value and force of the Rewards, and the contemplation of Honours, is equally to be conſidered. Nature affording us a kind of pleaſure, when we ſee Honour induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly coveted, and gratefully repaid. But though the Minde is carried here immediately to a ſplendid Houſe, the bountiful and moſt honoured Temple, it will be better reſtrain'd. For to him to whom the aſcent to Heaven is free, though the greateſt, yet they are
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:41263:203"/>than what are due, which are bellowed on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> the Conſulſhip was granted long before his time. To whom what was aſſign'd him in his life-time, would be too long to relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are many; and not neceſſary, as being in part already related. And therefore I will adde what is at this day eminent. He has an Image placed in Great <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, which when there is any Funeral of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Family, is fetch'd from thence: So that to that onely Image is the Capitol like a Porch, or place where thoſe Images are uſually placed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As truly as was the Senate-Houſe it ſelf to the Elder <hi>Cato</hi>'s Image, from whence it is brought forth upon the ſame occaſions of that Family. A Grateful Order, that would have ſo profitable a Member al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dwell with them, wealthy in all the Gifts of Vertue, and great rather by his own Merit, than by the benefit of Fortune; by whoſe counſel <hi>Carthage</hi> was ruin'd, before it was laid waſte by the Sword of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A rare Example of Honour ariſes alſo from <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Naſica.</hi> For by his Hands, and into his Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was yet a Queſtor, the Senate by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> would have the <hi>Mother of the gods</hi> received and entertained, when recalled from <hi>Peſſinuntes.</hi> Becauſe the ſame Oracle ordered thoſe Offices to be done to the <hi>Mother of the gods</hi> by a moſt holy man. Unfold all the <hi>Faſti,</hi> ſet all the Triumphal Chariots together, and you ſhall finde nothing more ſplendid than ſuch a preeminency in Manners.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Scipio</hi>'s often produce their Ornaments to be remembred by us. For <hi>Aemilianus</hi> was made a Conſul by the People, when but a Candidate for the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:41263:203"/>Aedil-ſhip. Which the Army adviſed the Senate ought to be done. So that it is hard to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Authority of the Conſcript Fathers, or the Counſel of the Souldiers added moſt Honour to him. For the Gown made <hi>Scipio</hi> Conſul againſt the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> but the Sword deſired him. And again, when he went into the field to the Election of the Queſtors, to give his voice for <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Brother, they brought him home a Conſul. To the ſame perſon the Senate gave a Province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lot, firſt <hi>Africa,</hi> then <hi>Spain.</hi> And theſe things neither to an ambitious Senator nor Citizen; as the moſt ſevere courſe of his Life, and his clandeſtine Death, being ſlain by treachery, declar'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As for <hi>M. Valerius,</hi> the Gods as well as his Fellow-Citizens made him famous for two things: The firſt by ſending a Crow for his defence, when he fought hand to hand with the <hi>Gaul;</hi> the other giving him the Conſulſhip at three and twenty years of Age. The <hi>Valerian</hi> Family aſſumes the name of <hi>Corvinus:</hi> The other is added as an Ornament, glorying as well in the earlineſs of the Conſulſhip, as in the priority of being made ſo.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nor was the Glory of <hi>Q. Scaevola,</hi> whom <hi>L. Craſſus</hi> had for his Colleague, leſs illuſtrious, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſo ſtoutly and ſo juſtly held it, that the Senate by their Decree propounded <hi>Scaevola</hi> as a Preſident and Example for others, that were to go into the ſeveral Provinces of the Empire.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe words of the Younger <hi>Africanus</hi> prudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſeven Conſulſhips and two Triumphs of <hi>C. Marius;</hi> for he was full of joy to his dying day: Who when he ſerved on Horſeback under that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Scipio</hi> being asked at Supper, if any thing croſs ſhould befal him, whom the Commonwealth would have equally great with him; the General looking
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:41263:204"/>upon <hi>Marius,</hi> ſitting a little below him, <hi>Even this man,</hi> anſwered he. By which Augury it cannot be well conjectured, whether the moſt perfect Vertue more certainly foreſaw a Riſing vertue, or whether he more efficaciouſly inflamed him to it. For that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Supper portended to <hi>Marius</hi> the moſt ſplendid future Suppers in the whole City. For when the Meſſenger brought the News, at the beginning of the Night, that the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> were overthrown, there was no man that offer'd not at his Table<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as it had been the Altar of the Immortal Gods.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now what large and new Honours were heap'd upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> partly by the flattery of Favour, partly by the noiſe of Envy! Being a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, he was ſent Conſul into <hi>Spain,</hi> with equal command to <hi>Pius Metellus</hi> Prince of the City. Before he had ſtood for any Honour, he triumph'd twice. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Magiſtracy he took from the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The Third Conſulſhip he ſway'd alone, by the Decree of the Senate. He triumph'd at once over <hi>Mithridates, Tigranes,</hi> and ſeveral other Kings, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cities, and the Pirats.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> alſo was, by the voice of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> within a little advanc'd to the Stars. For being ask'd by him in the Common-hall, whether they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to repoſe the whole management of all things in one <hi>Pompey,</hi> they cried out with one voice, <hi>In thee.</hi> The great force of a judgment of Reputation, which equall'd <hi>Catulus,</hi> included in the ſpace of two Syllables, to the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> with all the Ornaments that I have related.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The reception of <hi>M. Cato</hi> returning out of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with the Royal Money, may ſeem wonderful: To whom at his landing the Conſuls, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, the Senate and all the People of <hi>Rome</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended oat of duty. Rejoycing not at the vaſt
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:41263:204"/>weight of Gold and Silver, but for that <hi>Cato</hi> had brought back the Navy ſafe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But I cannot tell whether the Example of the unuſual Honour done to <hi>L. Marcius</hi> be not one of the chief; whom the two Armies upon the death of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> torn and ſhattered by the Victory of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> choſe him their General, when their ſafety was reduced to the laſt gaſp, leaving no place for Ambition.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Deſervedly <hi>Sulpitia</hi> deſerves to be remembred after the Men, the Daughter of <hi>Servius Paterculus,</hi> and the Wife of <hi>Fulvius Flaccus:</hi> Who when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, upon the Decemvirs inſpection into the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Books, had decreed that the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> Turn-heart ſhould be conſecrated, whereby the minds of the women might be changed from Luſt to Chaſtity; and that of all the Matrons an hundred, out of an hundred ten were choſen by Lot, to give judgment concerning the moſt chaſt Women, ſhe was preferr'd before all the reſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. But becauſe Forraign Honours may be related without any diminution of our <hi>Roman</hi> Majeſty, let us paſs over to them. The Hearers of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave him ſo much Veneration, that they accompted it a Crime to queſtion what they had received from him: And being asked the reaſon, they onely anſwered, that <hi>He had ſaid it.</hi> A great Man, but no farther than his School hitherto. However, the ſame vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was given him by Cities. The <hi>Crotoniates</hi> earneſtly deſired of him, that their Senate, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a Thouſand People, might take advice of him. And that opulent City, ſo frequently vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating his Houſe after his death, made it a Chappel to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:41263:205"/>
                        <hi>Ceres.</hi> And while that City flouriſhed, a Goddeſs was worſhipped in the remembrance of Man, and a Man in the remembrance of a Goddeſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Gorgias</hi> of <hi>Leontium</hi> ſo far excelled all perſons of that Age in Learning, that at all Aſſemblies he was wont to ask, what ſubject they would hear him diſpute upon; and for that reaſon all <hi>Greece</hi> ſet him up a Statue of maſſie Gold in the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> when the reſt, of his time, had only gilded Images.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame Nation by conſent ſtrove to honour <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> by reducing the place where he was buried, into the form and ſtate of a Temple, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Oracles to be there taken.

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:41263:206"/>tyed together by a double errour of the Minde.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>C. Sergius Orata</hi> was the firſt that made hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Barns; which coſt having but a ſlight beginning, extended it ſelf almoſt to Seas of Hot-water.</p>
                  <p>The ſame perſon, becauſe he would not have his Palace ſubject to the power of <hi>Neptune,</hi> invented pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Seas to himſelf, and ſeparated ſholes of divers ſorts of Fiſh within the large circuits of vaſt Moles, to the end no Tempeſt whatever ſhould deprive his Table of his deſired Dainties. He alſo burdened the (till then) deſert Banks of the Lake <hi>Lucrinus</hi> with ſtately and high Buildings, that he might keep his Shell-fiſh freſh. Where while he plunges himſelf too deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publick Water, he was hurried to the Judgment-Seat by <hi>Conſidius</hi> the Publican. Where <hi>L. Craſſus,</hi> pleading againſt him, ſaid, <hi>That his friend</hi> Conſidius <hi>err'd, if he thought that</hi> Orata, <hi>being removed from the Lake, would want Oyſters: for if he could not have them there, he would finde them upon the Tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this man <hi>Aeſopus</hi> the Tragedian ought rather to have given his Son in Adoption, than to have left him the Heir of his Goods; a young man not only of a deſperate, but a moſt furious Luxury. Of whom it is reported, that he gave vaſt prices for Birds that could ſing or talk, to have them ſerved up at his Table inſtead of <hi>Fig-peckers;</hi> and that he uſed to put Pearls of high value, diſſolv'd in Vinegar, into his drinks; as if he had ſtrain'd to throw away a moſt famous Patrimony, like ſome burthen too heavy for his ſhoulders. Since, ſome in imitation of the Father, others of the Son, have extended their hands farther. For no Vice ends where it begins. This it is that fetches out Fiſh from the various ſhoares of the Sea, and ſpreads our Kitchins with Oyſters. For the pleaſure of eating and drinking was found out by Art and Coſt.</p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:41263:206"/>
                  <p n="3">3. But the end of the ſecond <hi>Punic</hi> War, and the overcoming of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> made us with more confidence addict our ſelves to Luxury. At what time the Matrons were ſo bold as to beſet the Houſe of the <hi>Brutii,</hi> who by the abrogation of the <hi>Oppian</hi> Law, were prepar'd to intercede for that which the women deſir'd ſhould be taken away; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not permit them to wear a coloured Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to have about them above half an Ounce of Gold, nor to ride in a Chariot to any place within a Mile from the City, unleſs it were to the Sacrifices: and they obtain'd, that the Law kept for above twenty years, ſhould be aboliſhed. For the men of that Age did not foreſee whither the obſtinate Plots of Women would tend, nor how far a boldneſs that had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd the Law would tend. For could they have look'd into the contrivances of female cunning, that brings in ſomething of ſumptuous Novelty every day, they had ſtopped the progreſs of Luxuy at its firſt entrance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But what do I talk any more of Women? whom weakneſs of Minde, and the affectation of greater employments denied them, incites them to beſtow all their time in trimming up themſelves, when I finde Men fallen into this divertiſement, unknown to the antient Continence? And let it appear to their reproach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cneus Domitius,</hi> upon a quarrel with <hi>L. Craſſus</hi> his Colleague, objected to him, that he had <hi>Hymettian</hi> Pillars in his Houſe. Whom <hi>Craſſur</hi> immediately ask'd, what he valued his own Houſe at? When he anſwer'd, <hi>Threeſcore Seſterces. And hove much, think you,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>if I ſhould cut ten little ſhrubs out of it? Thirty Seſterces,</hi> ſaid the other. <hi>Which then is the moſt Luxurious of the two,</hi> replied <hi>Craſſus, I that bought ten Pillars for an hundred thouſand pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ces of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:41263:207"/>Money; or thou, that valueſt the ſhadow of ten ſmall Trees at thirty Seſterces?</hi> An expreſſion forgetful of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> unmindful of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and yawning with the abundance of Forreign Luxury; becauſe they had rather bequeath the Daintineſs and curioſity which they themſelves had begun, to their Poſterity, than retain the Continence which their Fore-fathers had left them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For what meant that Prince of his time, <hi>Metellus Pius,</hi> when he ſuffer'd himſelf to be received at his firſt coming, with Altars and Frankincenſe? When he beheld the walls of the Rooms ſpread with <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Tapeſtry, as a ſight that pleaſed him? When he permitted long Plays at tedious Feſtivals? When he wore his Triumphal Garment at the celebration of great Banquets, and contentedly received Crowns let down from open places, as it were from Heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his celeſtial Head? And where were theſe things? Not in <hi>Greece</hi> ox <hi>Aſia,</hi> where Severity itſelf might be corrupted with Luxury; but in a wild and warlike Province, when a formidable Enemy, <hi>Sertorius,</hi> would not let the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies lie quiet; but goar'd them continually with the <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Darts. So much had he forgot the <hi>Numidian</hi> Camp of his father. Whence it appears how ſwiftly Luxury inſinuates it ſelf. For he that in his Youth beheld the antient Cuſtomes, in his old Age introduced new.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſame change was in the Houſe of the <hi>Curii;</hi> while our City and Judgment-Seat beheld the rigid Brow of the Father, and the high Debt of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Seſterces of the Son, contracted by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Injury done to the Noble Youth of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore at the ſame Time, and under the ſame Roof, two ſeveral Ages lived; the one of Frugality, the other of vitious Prodigality.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By the Sentence againſt <hi>P. Clodius,</hi> what ſtrange
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:41263:207"/>Luxury appeared in him, what a ſavage Luſt? Who, though guilty of Inceſt, that he might be acquitted, bought whole nights of the Matrons and noble Youth, at vaſt rates, to pleaſure his Judges withal. In which horrid and abominable Crime, I know not which firſt to deteſt; whether him that firſt invented that way of Corruption; or they that ſuffer'd their Chaſtity to mediate to Perjury; or they that valued Adultery beyond Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Equally abominable was that Banquet, which <hi>Gemellus</hi> a <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Traveller, of good Parents, but one that had betaken himſelf to a Servile employment, prepar'd for <hi>Metellus Scipio</hi> Conſul, and the Tribunes of the People, to the great ſcandal of the City. For having ſet up a Stew in his own Houſe, he proſtituted therein <hi>Mucia</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> both taken away from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and <hi>Saturninus</hi> a Youth of a Noble Family. Bodies of infamous ſuffering, brought to be the ſcorn of drunken Luſt! Banquets not to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by Conſuls and Tribunes, but to have been puniſh'd.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But enormous was the Luſt of <hi>Catiline:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad in love with <hi>Aurelia Oreſtilla,</hi> when he ſaw one Impediment to hinder him from being married to her, poyſon'd his own and only Son, almoſt of age; and preſently kindled the Nuptial Torch at his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Pile, bequeathing his want of Children as a gift to his new Bride. But behaving himſelf at length with the ſame minde as a Citizen, as he had ſhewed himſelf a Father, he fell a juſt Sacrifice to the Ghoſt of his Son, and his impiouſly-invaded Country.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. But the <hi>Campanian</hi> Luxury, how profitable was it to our Country? For embracing invincible <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
                        <pb n="432" facs="tcp:41263:208"/>in the arms of her Allurements, ſhe fitted him to be vanquiſhed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier. She called forth a vigilant Captain, ſhe invited a couragious Army to long Banquets, and with plenty of Wine, the fragrancy of Oyntments, and the laſcivious ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Venery, inveagl'd them to Sleep and Pleaſure. And then was the <hi>Punie</hi> fierceneſs broken, when it lay encamped among the Perfumers of <hi>Capua.</hi> What then more ignominious than theſe Vices, what more hurtful; by which Vertue is worn out, Victories lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, Honour ſtupified is turn'd to Infamy; and the vigour of Body and Minde quite weakned and broken? So that it is hard to ſay which is worſt, to be ſubdued by them, or by the Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Which infeſted the City of the <hi>Volſinians</hi> with ſad and direful ſlaughters. It was rich, it was adorn'd with Cuſtomes and Laws: it was the Head and Metropolis of <hi>Hetruria.</hi> But when once Luxury crept in, it fell into an Abyſs of Injuries and Infamy, till ſhe became ſubjected to the inſolent power of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Who at firſt in a ſmall number daring to enter the Senate-Houſe, in a ſhort time overturn'd and maſter'd the whole Commonwealth. They order'd Wills to be made at their own pleaſure. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Meetings and Feaſtings of the Free-men, and married their Maſters Daughters. Laſtly, they made a Law, that their Adulteries committed with Widows and Married-women ſhould go unpuniſhed; and that no Virgin ſhould marry a Freeman, unleſs ſome of them before had had her Virginity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Xerxes,</hi> out of the proud imitation of his vaſt wealth, grew to that height of Luxury, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Rewards to them that ſhould invent any new Pleaſure. What a ruine befel a moſt wide Empire, too deeply plunged in Pleaſure and Voluptuouſneſs!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Antiochus</hi> the King not a whit the more conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41263:208"/>whoſe blinde and mad Luxury the Army imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, had moſt of them Golden Nails under the ſoles of their Shoes; and bought Silver Diſhes for their Kitchins; and bad their Tents of Tapeſtry-work adorn'd with Gold and Silver. A booty more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a needy Enemy, than any delay to a ſtout Souldier from Victory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> the King liv'd by the acceſſion of his Vices, and was therefore call'd <hi>Phyſcon:</hi> Than whoſe Wickedneſs there could be nothing more wicked. He married his eldeſt Siſter, married before to their common Brother; then having vitiated her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he divorced the Siſter, that he might marry the Daughter.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Like to their Kings were the People of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who under the command of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> ſallying out of their City againſt <hi>A. Gabinius,</hi> when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="7">7. But more effeminate were the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> who ſuffer'd their Women to lye upon the ground, for their Queens to tread upon, when they aſcended into their Chariots.

In ſhort, ſince it is her buſineſs to make herſelf dreaded, let it be ours, to have her in abomination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> whom no man can either ſufficiently praiſe or diſpraiſe; who while he ſeeks after Victory, repreſents himſelf a <hi>Scipio</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> People; while he exerciſes Cruelty, a meer <hi>Hannibal.</hi> For having egregiouſly defended the cauſe of the Nobility, cruelly he overflow'd the whole City, and every part
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41263:209"/>of <hi>Italy,</hi> with rivers of Civil Blood. Four Legions of the adverſe party, truſting to his Faith, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Banners, in a publick Village, in vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the compaſſion of his faithleſs arm, he cauſed to be cut in pieces. Whoſe lamentable cries pierc'd the ears of the trembling City: and <hi>Tibur</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to waft away their memberleſs Bodies, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of ſo heavy a burthen. Five thouſand <hi>Praeneſtines,</hi> hope of ſafety being granted them by <hi>Cethegus,</hi> being call'd forth without the Walls of the Free-town, after they had thrown away their Armes, and lay proſtrate upon the ground, he caus'd to be ſlain, and their Bodies to be thrown about the fields. He cauſed a Record to be made of four thouſand ſeven hundred murder'd upon the dire decree of Proſcription. Nor content to rage againſt them who had born Armes againſt him, he added alſo to the number of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, ſeveral peaceable Citizens, whoſe names he collected by the <hi>Nomenclator:</hi> He alſo drew his Sword againſt the Women, not ſatisfi'd with the ſlaughter of the men. That was alſo a ſigne of incredible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiety, that he cauſed the Heads of the miſerable creatures, newly cut off, and as yet retaining their Phyſiognomies and Breath, to be brought into his preſence, that what he could not devour with his teeth, he might with his eyes. How cruelly did he carry himſelf toward <hi>M. Marius</hi> the Praetor, who being dragg'd in the ſight of the people to the Sepulcher of the <hi>Lutatian</hi> Family, he would not put him to death, till he had digg'd out his eyes, and broken the ſeveral members of that unfortunate perſon. Methinks I hardly ſeem to relate Truths. And yet becauſe <hi>M. Plaetorius</hi> fell into a Swoon upon the Execution of <hi>Marius,</hi> he preſently flew him. A new Puniſher of Pitie, with whom to behold wickedneſs with an averſe minde, was to commit a Crime. But ſure he
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:41263:210"/>ſpar'd the ſhades of the Dead? No. For digging up the aſhes of <hi>C. Marius,</hi> whoſe Quaeſtor once he was, though afterwards his Enemy, he ſcatter'd them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the river <hi>Anio.</hi> Behold by what acts he thought to obtain the name of <hi>Happy!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of which Cruelty however <hi>C. Marius</hi> mitigates the envy. For he out of an eager deſire of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Enemies, wickedly unſheath'd his Anger; with an ignoble Severity diſmembring the honoured Body of <hi>L. Caeſar</hi> of the Conſular and Cenſor's Dignity; and at the Sepulcher of a moſt abject and ſeditious perſon: For that miſchief was wanting to the miſerable Republique, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould fall a Victime to <hi>Varius.</hi> Hardly were his Victories of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual value; which when he forgot, he became more criminal at home, than praiſe-worthy for his Victories abroad. The ſame perſon, when the Head of <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> cut off, was brought him, betray'd much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence both of thought and words, as he held it in his joyful hands, in the midſt of a Banquet; ſuffering the Sacred's of the Table to be contaminated with the Blood of a moſt famous Commonwealths man and Orator. More than that, he received <hi>P. Annius,</hi> that brought it, reaking with the freſh blood, into his Boſome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Damaſippus</hi> had no praiſe; and therefore his memory may be the more ſeverely proſecuted: by whoſe commands the Heads of the principal Men of the City were mingled with the heads of the Sacrifices; and the headleſs Body of <hi>Carbo Arvina</hi> carried about, nail'd to the Gallows. So that the Pretorſhip of a moſt licentious man could do much, or the Authority of the Commonwealth nothing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Munatius Flaccus,</hi> a more ſtiff than approved defender of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party, when he was beſieged by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> within the walls of <hi>Attegua,</hi> he
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:41263:210"/>exercis'd his ſavage Cruelty after a moſt truculent manner. For after he had kill'd all the Citizens which he thought well affected to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he threw them headlong from the Walls. He alſo murder'd the Women, calling their Husbands firſt that were in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp to the walls, to the end they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſlaughter of their Wives. Nor did he ſpare the Children laid upon their Mothers laps; ſuffering the render Infants to be ſome daſh'd againſt the ſtones, others to be thrown up and to fall upon the ſtakes. Which things, intolerable to be heard, were executed by <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> at the command of a <hi>Roman;</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance, <hi>Flaccus</hi> well fortified, withſtood the divine Labours of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with a doting obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Let us paſs to thoſe, for which though there be the ſame grief, yet there is not the ſame reaſon for our City to bluſh. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> put <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> to death after a doleful manner. For having cut off his Eye-brows, and ſhut him up in a little wooden caſe, wherein there was nothing but ſharp nails, they ſuffer'd him to linger with continual watching, and in a long ſeries of pain. A kind of Torment not worthy him that ſuffer'd, but becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authors of it. The ſame Cruelty they uſed toward our Souldiers, whom being taken in a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight, they faſten'd under the bottom of their Ships, that being cruſh'd to death by the weight of the Keel, they might ſatiate their barbarous ferity, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual kinde of death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Captain <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whoſe chiefeſt Vertue conſiſted in Cruelty, made a Bridge over the River <hi>Vergellus</hi> with the bodies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſo led
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:41263:211"/>over his Army, that the Earth might experiment the wickedneſs of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Land-forces, as the Sea had beheld the barbarity of their Mariners. Thoſe whom he had taken priſoners, picking out the neareſt of Kin that he could, he compell'd to fight by pairs, till he made them deſtroy one another. Thoſe that were tir'd he left upon the Road, with the lower part of their Feet cut off. Deſervedly therefore, though too ſlow the puniſhment were, the Senate forced him, when a Suppliant to King <hi>Pruſias,</hi> to a voluntary Death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As truely had they reaſon to abominate <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,</hi> who with one Epiſtle ſlew fourſcore thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, diſpers'd over <hi>Aſia</hi> as Merchants, defiling the hoſpitable Gods of ſo large a Province, with blood unjuſtly ſhed, though not unrevenged. For which intolerable torment, at length he compell'd that Vital Spirit to ſubmit, that contended with the poyſon. Thereby attaining thoſe torments, which he had made his own friends to ſuffer at the beck of <hi>Gaurus</hi> his Eunuch, to whom his obedient Luſt could deny nothing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Numulizinthis Diogiris</hi> the King of <hi>Thrace</hi>'s Daughters Cruelty, though not ſo much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, conſidering the Barbarity of the Nation, yet the horridneſs will not let it be paſs'd in ſilence: who held it not unlawful to cut living men in two in the middle, or for Parents to feed upon the bodies of their Children.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Again <hi>Ptolomey Phyſcon</hi> comes upon the ſtage; a little before, a moſt dreadful Example of luſtful Madneſs, now of Cruelty. For what more horrid than this? He caus'd his own Son <hi>Menephites,</hi> whom he had got upon <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Siſter and Wife, a lovely and hopeful Youth, to be kill'd in his preſence; and ſent the Head, Feet and Hands cut off, and put into
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:41263:211"/>a Cheſt, cover'd over with the Child's Garment, as a Birth-day Gift to the Mother. As it altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the miſchief he had done, and never the more unfortunate, for having render'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> miſerable in the loſs of Children common to both, and himſelf odious to all. With ſo blinde a fury doth the height of Cruelty rage, when ſhe thinks to ſtrengthen her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by her own acts! For when he underſtood how he was hated by his people, he ſought a remedy for his fear in wickedneſs; and that he might raign more ſafely when the people were murder'd, he ſurrounded the <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> full of young people, with fire and ſword, and ſlew, partly by the flame, and partly by ſword, every individual perſon of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But <hi>Ochus,</hi> who was afterwards call'd <hi>Darius,</hi> bound to the <hi>Perſians</hi> by a moſt bloody Oath, that he ſhould not put to Death either by Sword, Poyſon, Starving, or any other manner of violence, any of thoſe that had conſpir'd with him againſt the Seven <hi>Magi,</hi> found out a way of Death, by which means he might rid himſelf of thoſe perſons that were burthenſome to him, and yet ſave his Oath. For he fill'd a place, made up with high walls, full of Aſhes, and putting a leaning rafter underneath, he placed them in it, after he had highly feaſted them; ſo that when ſleep ſhould ſeize them, they might fall into that inſidiary heap.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. More open, but more horrid, was the Cruelty of <hi>Ochus Artaxerxes,</hi> who buried his Siſter and Mother-in-Law <hi>Ocha</hi> alive: and ſtab'd his Uncle to Death with Darts, after he had deprived him of an hundred Sons and Nephews; for not the leaſt injury done him, but becauſe they had the higheſt applauſe among the <hi>Perſians</hi> for Probity and Fortitude.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Guided by the ſame wicked Suſpition, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:41263:212"/>of <hi>Athens,</hi> by a Decree unworthy their Honour, cut off the Thumbs of the <hi>Aeginenſian</hi> Youth; that a People potent in Shipping, might not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them at Sea. I cannot pardon the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> borrowing a remedy for their fear from Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Cruel alſo was that Inventor of the Brazen Bull, wherein when poor Creatures were lock'd, and fire put under it, they ſeem'd in the midſt of their long and tedious torments to low like the beaſt, that their lamentations and howlings expreſs'd in Humane Sounds, might not reach the ears of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to move his compaſſion. Which becauſe he would be wanting to the miſerable, the firſt Authour deſervedly experimented the torment of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Nor were the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> a little cruel in the Invention of Puniſhment, who tying the bodies of the living back to back, and face to face together, ſo that part might anſwer part, ſuffer'd them to lye till they were putrified to Death. Moſt bitter Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of Life and Death at once.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Like thoſe Barbarians, who are reported to ſet men in heaps of the Bowels and Entrails of kill'd beaſts, and theſe to feed and keep them alive, till being putrified within, they might be eaten up by the Vermine that breed in putrified bodies. Can we complain of Nature, for having made us lyable to many and dire inconveniencies of Sickneſs; or take it ill, that Celeſtial Strength ſhould be denied to humane condition, when Mortality hath invented ſo many Torments to ruine it ſelf, by the impulſe of Cruelty?</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ANger and Hatred ſtir up great Commotions in he breaſts of Men. This ſwifter in its motion, the other more obſtinate in the deſire of Miſchief. Both affections full of Conſtermation, and never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violent torment of themſelves: For it ſuffers pain to inflict miſery; anxious with a bitter care, leſt revenge ſhould happen to miſs. But there are moſt certain images of their propriety, which the gods would have conſpicuous in great men, by ſome more than ordinary Act or Saying.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Livius Salinator,</hi> waging war with <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi> was about to leave the City, being admoniſh'd by <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> that he ſhould not fight before he underſtood the courage and force of the Enemy, made anſwer, that <hi>He would not refuſe the firſt opportunity of fighting:</hi> And being ask'd by the ſame perſon, why he would needs be ſo haſty; <hi>That aſſoon as may be,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I may either win honour by the overthrow of the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:41263:213"/>Enemy, or rejoyce in the ruine of my Fellow-Citizens.</hi> Anger and Vertue divided his ſpeech between them. The one remembring an unjuſt rebuke, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the honour of Triumph. But I cannot tell whether it were the ſame thing to ſay this, and to overcome in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus far Paſſion carried a man of a fierce Soul and accuſtom'd to War. But <hi>C. Figulus</hi> a moſt milde man, famous for his learning in the Civil Law, was thereby render'd forgetful both of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For being provok'd by being repuls'd from the Conſulſhip, ſo much the rather, becauſe it had been twice given his Fathers; when many came to him the next day for counſel, turn'd '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m all out a doors: <hi>Are ye ready at asking Counſel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and know not how to make a Conſul?</hi> Smartly and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſpoken: Yet it had been better not ſpoken. For what wiſe man could be angry with the People of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor are they to be approved, though protected by the ſplendour of their Nobility, who being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe that <hi>Cn. Flavius,</hi> a man of mean extract, was made Praetor, took off their Gold Rings and Trappings from their Horſes, and threw them away; ſhewing the impotency, not the ſtrife of vexation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe were the motions of Anger in ſingle or but few perſons agaiſt a Commonwealth: There are alſo the ſame in the Multitude againſt the Princes and Captains. <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> returning after a moſt renowned and compleat Victory over the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Campanians,</hi> when all the Old-people went forth to meet him, the Youth never ſtirr'd; becauſe he had put his Son to death, for fighting ſucceſsfully againſt the Enemy. His equals compaſſionated his too ſevere puniſhment. Nor do I defend the Act, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the force of Anger, that could divide the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41263:213"/>Ages and Affections of a whole City.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So much could it prevail, that it detain'd and kept back all the foot of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, ſent by <hi>Fabius</hi> the Conſul to purſue the Enemy, when they might eaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y have ruin'd and cut them off, when they call'd to minde that he had put a ſtop to the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law. The ſame paſſion rendring the Army offended with <hi>Appius</hi> their Captain uſeleſs, (whoſe Father ſtanding for the Nobility, oppos'd the conveniences of the Commonalty) by a voluntary flight they turn'd their back to the Enemy, becauſe they would not ſuffer their Captain to triumph. How often the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſher of Victory? deſpiſing its congratulation in <hi>Torquatus;</hi> in <hi>Fabius,</hi> omitting the greateſt part; in <hi>Appius,</hi> preferring ſhameful flight before it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How violently it carried it ſelf in the breaſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, at that time when the Dedication of the Temple of <hi>Mercury</hi> was granted to <hi>M. Plaeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a Centurion, by their Suffrages! The Conſuls being alſo terrified; <hi>Claudius,</hi> becauſe he withſtood the relief of his Debts; and <hi>Servilius,</hi> becauſe he had but weakly defended their cauſe which he undertook, Can Anger be denied to be of force, when it ſets the Souldier above the General?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It hath not only pull'd down Authority, but commanded as diſorderly. For when <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> firſt as Conful, then for the Conſul, had ſubdued almoſt all <hi>Spain,</hi> and underſtood that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Conſul, his enemy, would be ſent to ſucceed him; he diſmiſſed all that pretended to be acquitted from ſervice; gave licence to the Souldiers to go take their pleaſure, never ſetting any time for their coming again. He left the Magazines upon the Borders free to the plunder of the Enemy: He ordered the <hi>Cretans</hi> Bows and Arrows to be broken and thrown into the River: He forbid any Victuals to be given to the Elephants. By which acts
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:41263:214"/>as he gratified his Paſſion, ſo he ſufficiently ſullied the glory of his great Deeds: and loſt the honour he had won, being a greater Vanquiſher of the Enemy, than of his own Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What became of <hi>Sylla,</hi> too obedient to this Vice! After he had ſhed the blood of others, did he not ſhed his own ? For burning with indignation at <hi>Puteoli,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Granius</hi> Prince of the Colony did not pay in ſo quickly the Money to the <hi>Decurio</hi>'s, which he had promis'd for the repair of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> with a concitation of minde more than ordinary, and an immoderate force of ſpeaking, he vomited up his laſt breath, mixed with blood and threats. Not failing by old Age, as not being above threeſcore; but raging with an Impotency, nouriſhed by the miſeries of the Commonwealth. So that it is a doubt whether <hi>Sylla</hi> or <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Anger were firſt extinguiſhed.</p>

                     <p>Now it behoves us to fetch Examples from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known perſons; yet there is ſomething of ſhame in reproaching the Vices of great men. But ſince the faith of our deſigne admoniſhes us to comprehend every thing, the Will muſt give way to the Work; that the Conſidence of declaring neceſſary things may not be wanting, while we juſtifie the proof of great things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Alexander</hi> was kept from Heav'n by his own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For what hinder'd but that he might have riſen thither, had not <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> thrown to a Lion, <hi>Elytus</hi> run through with a Spear, <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> put to death, loſt him the fame of three of his greateſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, by the unjuſt ſlaughter of ſo many friends.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How exceſſive the Hatred of <hi>Amilear</hi> toward the <hi>Roman</hi> People! For beholding four Sons of tender
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:41263:214"/>Age, and the ſame number of Lions whelps; <hi>He bred them,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>to the ruine of our Empire.</hi> Fairly brought up, as it hapned, to the ruine of their own Country.</p>
                     <p>n"3" 3. Of which Sons <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſo followed his Fathers ſteps, that when he was about to croſs the Army over into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſacrificing for good ſucceſs, the Son then but nine years of age, holding his hand upon the Altar, ſwore, that aſſoon as his Age would permit him, he would be a moſt bitter Enemy to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> that he might expreſs to his father how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly he accompanied him in the War then afoot. The ſame perſon, that he might ſhew the Hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> happening to ſtumble, and raiſe the duſt with his foot, <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there will be an end of the War between theſe two Cities, when one of them is reduced into duſt at this is.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. In the breaſt of a Boy the Force of Hatred was not ſo prevalent, but that it equally prevailed in a Womans breaſt. For <hi>Semiramis</hi> Queen of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> when it was related to her, as ſhe was combing her hair, that <hi>Babylon</hi> was revolted, with one part of her hair looſe and diſhevell'd, ſhe haſted to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; nor would ſhe bring her hair, till ſhe had reduced the City, into order.

                  <p n="1">1. When certain perſons had ſuborn'd a falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt <hi>Minucius Baſilius</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> who was very rich, to confirm it, they put into his Will, as Heirs, two of the moſt potent men of our City, <hi>M.

The Lights of the Court, and Ornaments of the Seat of Judicature, what they ought to have puniſh'd, invited by the bait of diſhoneſt gain, they protected by their Authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it was of greater force in <hi>Q. Caſſius,</hi> who let go <hi>M. Silius</hi> and <hi>A.

                  <p n="3">3. But above all, the Avarice of <hi>L. Septimuleius</hi> was moſt notorious: Who being a familiar Friend of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> not only cut off his Head, but carried it fix'd upon a pole through the City; becauſe <hi>Opimius,</hi> the Conſul, had promis'd a reward in Gold to him that ſhould do it.

Then when the Senate partly admoniſh'd him, partly beſought him to deſiſt, he gave them no anſwer. He might be accompted a Tyrannical Conſul, who had thus carried himſelf againſt one Senator, as <hi>Flaccus</hi> did againſt the whole Body of ſo Majeſtick an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whoſe Majeſty was no leſs affronted by the contumely of <hi>M.

                  <p n="3">3. Too great a deſire of Glory made <hi>Cn. Domitius,</hi> a perſon of Noble Extraction and Merit, to become perfidious.

                  <p n="1">1.

But at length, when he found what the Pilot had ſaid to be true, pardon'd him too late; when he could pay no reſpect to his Innocence, but that of a Sepulchre. And therefore in the midſt of a narrow and tempeſtuous Frith, ſtands an overlooking Statue, expos'd to the eyes of them that ſail to and fro, in remembrance of <hi>Pelorium</hi> and the <hi>Punic</hi> Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>ERrour is next to Raſhneſs: as equally prejudicial, ſo to them alſo it leaſt knows: becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits miſtakes not willingly, but out of falſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; which being far ſpread in the breaſt of men, if I ſhould omit it, I ſhould be guilty of the Errour which I blame. Therefore let us recite a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>C. Helvius Cinna,</hi> Tribune of the People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home from <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Funeral, was torn by the hands of the People, miſtaken for <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> upon whom they thought to have ſpent their rage; provoked againſt him, becauſe that being <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Kinſman, he had made an abuſive Oration againſt him that was impiouſly ſlain.

                  <p n="2">2. For Errour cauſed <hi>C. Caſſius</hi> to puniſh himſelf. For in the midſt of that various and unknown event <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Captains themſelves, of the fight of four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at <hi>Philippi; Titinius</hi> the Centurion being ſent by him in the Night to ſee in what condition <hi>Brutus</hi> was, while he fetch'd ſeveral compaſſes about, becauſe the darkneſs of the Night did not ſuffer him to know
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:41263:221"/>whether he met Foes or Friends, it was long before he return'd. <hi>Caſſius</hi> therefore believing him to have been taken by the Enemy, and that they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſters of the field, haſten'd to end his life, when <hi>Brutus</hi>'s forces were in part ſafe, and Maſters of the Enemies Camp. But the Courage of <hi>Titinius</hi> is not to be forgot, who ſtood a while aſtoniſh'd at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſight of his Captain wallowing in his own blood, then burſting into tears; <hi>Though imprudently, General,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I was the cauſe of thy death, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence ſhall not go unpuniſh'd; receive me a companion to thy fate;</hi> and ſo ſaying, threw himſelf upon the liveleſs trunk, with his Sword up to the Hilts in his own Body: And intermixing blood with blood, they lay a double ſacrifice, the one of Piety, the other of Errour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But certainly Miſtake did a great injury to the family of <hi>Lartis Talumnius</hi> King of the <hi>Veientes;</hi> who after he had through a lucky caſt at Dice, cried to his Play-mate, <hi>Kill;</hi> the Guard, miſtaking the word, fell upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſadours, and ſlew them, as they were juſt entring the Room; interpreting Play as a Command.</p>

                  <p>THe Stings of Revenge as they are ſharp, ſo they are juſt, while they meditate to repay received Injuries. Of which a few Examples will ſerve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>M. Flavius,</hi> Tribune of the People, reported to the People againſt the <hi>Tuſculans,</hi> that by their advice the <hi>Privernates</hi> and <hi>Veliterni</hi> would rebel. Who when they came to <hi>Rome</hi> in a moſt miſerable and ſuppliant manner, with their Wives and Children, it hapned that all the reſt of the Tribes being for Mercy, the <hi>Polian</hi> Tribe alone gave judgment that they ſhould be firſt whipp'd, and then put to death; and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Women and Children to be ſold for Slaves. For which reaſon the <hi>Papyrian</hi> Tribe, in which the <hi>Tuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> being received into the City, had a ſtrong Vote, never made afterwards any Candidate of the <hi>Polian</hi> Tribe a Magiſtrate; that no Honour might come to that Tribe, which as much as in them lay, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deprive them of their Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this Revenge both the Senate and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all men approved. For when <hi>Adrianus</hi> had
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:41263:222"/>ſordidly tyrannized over the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and was therefore by them burnt alive; the matter was never queſtion'd in the City, nor any complaint made againſt it.</p>
                  <div type="examples"><!-- @N removed: "foreign" -->
                     <head>FORREIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Famous Examples of Revenge were both Queens: <hi>Thamyris,</hi> who having cauſed the Head of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be cut off, commanded it to be thrown into a Tub of humane Blood; upbraiding him with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable thirſt after Blood, and revenging upon him the Death of her Son, who was ſlain by him. And <hi>Berenice,</hi> who taking heavily the loſs of her Son, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped by the ſnares of <hi>Laodice,</hi> got arm'd into her Chariot, and following the Kings Life-guard-man that had done the Miſchief, after ſhe had miſs'd him with her Spear, ſhe ſell'd him with a Stone; and driving her Horſes over his Body, rid directly through the bands of the adverſe party to the houſe where ſhe thought the body of the ſlain Child lay.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a hard thing to judge whether a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or not were the ruine of <hi>Jaſon</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> preparing to make war againſt the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> For he gave leave to <hi>Taxillus</hi> the Matter of his Games, complaining that he had been abuſed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain young men, that he ſhould either require thirty Drachma's from them, or to give them ten Stripes. Which laſt revenge when he uſed, they that were laſh'd, kill'd <hi>Jaſon;</hi> valuing the meaſure of the puniſhment by the pain of the Minde, and nor of the Body. Thus by a ſmall provocation of ingenious Shame, a great Undertaking was ſubverted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the opinion of <hi>Greece,</hi> there was as much expected from <hi>Jaſon,</hi> as from <hi>Alexander.</hi>

                  <p>NOw becauſe we purſue the good and bad things of humane Life, let us go on with what hath been naughtily ſaid, and wickedly done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But where ſhall I better begin than from <hi>Tullia?</hi> as being the ancienteſt in time, the wickedeſt and moſt monſtrous Example of Impiety. Who, when her Charioteer, as ſhe was riding in her Chariot, ſtopp'd his Horſes; upon her enquiry finding that the dead body of her Father, <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> lay in the way, caus'd the Charioteer to drive over it; that ſhe might haſten to the embraces of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> who had ſlain him. By which impious and ſhameful haſte, ſhe not only ſtain'd herſelf with eternal Infamy, but alſo the very Village it ſelf, which was called, <hi>The wicked Village,</hi> after that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not ſo horrible was the Act and Saying of <hi>C. Fimbria;</hi> though conſider'd by themſelves, both very abominable. He had order'd it, that <hi>Scaevola</hi> ſhould
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:41263:223"/>be killed at the Funeral of <hi>C. Marius;</hi> whom after he found to be recovered of his Wound, he reſolv'd to accuſe to the People. Being then ask'd what he could ſay truely of him, whoſe converſation was not to be blamed; anſwered, that he would accuſe him, <hi>For not receiving the Dart any further into his Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>L. Catiline, Cicero</hi> ſaying in the Senate, that there was a great fire kindled by him; <hi>I perceive it,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>and if I could not quench it with Water, I would with Ruine.</hi> What can we think, but that the ſtings of his Conſcience moved him to finiſh the act of Parricide which he began?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Breaſt of <hi>Magius Chilo</hi> was deeply troubled with Madneſs: Who with his own hand ſnatch'd away <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Life that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had given him. For being an old Souldier under <hi>Pompey,</hi> he took it ill that any of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s friends ſhould be preferr'd before him. For as he was upon his return from <hi>Mitylene</hi> to the City, he ſtabb'd him with a Dagger in the Port of <hi>Athens.</hi> An Enemy of Friendſhip, an Intercepter of divine Favour, and the Ignominy of publick Faith, which had promis'd the Life of ſo great a perſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To this Cruelty, to which there ſeems no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, <hi>C. Caius Toranius</hi> exceeds in heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Parricide. For adhering to the Faction of the Triumviri, he deſcribed to the Centurions the marks, the age and lurking places of his proſcrib'd Father, a famous perſon, and of the Praetorian Order, to the end they might finde him out. The Old-man more concerned for the life and advancement of his Son, than for the remainder of his days, enquired of the Centurions whether his Son were ſafe, and whether he pleas'd his Generals. One of which made anſwer, <hi>Being ſhewed by him,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whom thou ſo much loveſt, we are come to be thy Executioners;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ran him through. Thus fell that unhappy man,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:41263:224"/>more miſerable in the author of his Death, then in his Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Which was the bitter Lot of <hi>L. Villius Annlis.</hi> Who coming into the Field to the choice of his Son for Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, and knowing himſelf to be proſcrib'd, flew to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">
                        <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>ion. But the wickedneſs of the Youngman was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> cauſe, that he was not ſafe in his Protection: For he deliver'd him up to the Souldiers, that followed his ſteps, to be ſlain in his preſence. Twice a Parricide, by Counſel, and beholding the ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Vettius Sallaſſus</hi> proſcrib'd, had an end no leſs bitter; whom being hidden, what ſhall I ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Wife delivered him to be ſlain, or ſlew him her ſelf? For how can we think the Crime leſs, where the hand is only abſent?</p>
                  <div type="examples"><!-- @N removed: "foreign" -->
                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. But this fact, becauſe Forraign, ſhall be more calmly deliver'd. <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> celebrating the Memory of his Father and his Uncle at <hi>New Carthage</hi> with a Gladiatory gift, two Kings Sons, their Father being dead, enter'd upon the Sand; promiſing there to fight for the Kingdom, that their Combat might make the ſpectacle mere famous. Them when <hi>Scipio</hi> admoniſh'd rather to contend in words than blows who ſhould reign, and that the elder ſubmitted to his advice; the younger, truſting to his ſtrength, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſed in his Madneſs. But the iſſue of the Combat was, that the more obſtinate Impiety was puniſhed with Death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Mithridates</hi> much move wickedly; who not only made war with his Brother, but with his own Father himſelf for the Kingdom. Wherein, how he got aſſiſtants to help him, or durſt invoke the gods, is to me a wonder.</p>
                     <pb n="465" facs="tcp:41263:224"/>
                     <p n="3">3. But why ſhould we wonder at a thing as not uſual with thoſe people? When <hi>Sariaſter</hi> ſo conſpir'd with his friends againſt <hi>Tigranes</hi> his Father, King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that all of them let themſelves blood in their right hands, and drank it up. Hardly were ſuch a bloody Conſpiracy to be endur'd for the ſafety of a Parent.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But why do I ſlay upon theſe Examples, when I ſee all Villanies exceeded by the thought of one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide? And therefore I am tranſported to dilacerate it with a pious, rather than ſtrong affection. For who, the ſaith of Friendſhip being extinct, can finde words enough to ſend to the Abyſs of due execration the perſon that endeavoured the ſubverſion of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde? Couldſt thou, more cruel than the Cruelty of Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ariſm it ſelf, have rul'd the reins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which our Prince and Parent governs with his protecting Arm? Or while thou wert ſo mad, could the world have remained ſteady? Thy purpoſe was to have repreſented the mad intentions of thy fury, and to have outdone the City taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the ſlaughter of the three hundred Noblemen, the Battle of <hi>Allia,</hi> the <hi>Scipio's</hi> ruined in <hi>Spain, Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymene, Cannae,</hi> and <hi>Aemathia,</hi> reaking with Civil Blood. But the Eyes of the Gods were awake, the Stars were alſo watchful; the Altars, Beds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were full of the preſent Numen. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing permitted to grow drowſie, that was to watch over the head and ſafety of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And in the firſt place the Author and Defender of our ſafety by his divine wiſdome provided, leſt his famous works ſhould have been buried in the ruine of the whole world. Therefore Peace remains, the Laws are in force, and the order of publick and private Duty ſtands faſt. For he that endeavoured to ſubvert all theſe, by violating the bonds of Friendſhip, trod under
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:41263:225"/>foot with all his Family by the <hi>Roman</hi> People, hath now his puniſhment in Hell, if he deſerve to be there.</p>

                  <p>THe firſt and laſt day contain the condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life; for it is of great concern with what lucky Omens it begins, and how it ends. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we accompt him happy that begins his Life with proſperity, and ends it with quietneſs. The middle courſe of time is ſometimes rugged, ſometimes calm; always deceiving hope, while we wiſh it long, and yet idly conſume it. For by uſing it well, a ſhort time becomes long, exceeding the multitude of years in the number of famous actions. But not to wander
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41263:225"/>farther, let us mention thoſe that have died no Vulgar Deaths.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> the King was ſtruck with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and burnt together with his whole Palace. A ſingular Lot of Fate, by which it happen'd, that the Pillar of the City, taken away in the City it ſelf, was reduced into that condition by the flame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Citizens might not have the honour of beſtowing the laſt Funeral Rites upon it, the Palace being both Funeral-Pile and Sepulcher.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a ſtrange thing that Joy ſhould do the ſame as Thunder; and yet it did. For news being brought of the ſlaughter at <hi>Thraſymene;</hi> One Mother meeting her Son ſafe in the Gate, expir'd in his arms; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the falſe news of her Sons death, ſitting melancholy at home, at the firſt ſight of him, when he return'd, fell down dead. An unuſual accident, that they whom Grief could not, Joy ſhould kill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But I wonder the leſs becauſe they were Women. <hi>Juventius Thalna,</hi> Colleague with <hi>T. Graccbus</hi> the Conſul, ſacrificing in <hi>Corſica,</hi> which he had newly ſubdued, and receiving Letters that Supplications were decreed by the Senate, as he was intently reading them, a miſt roſe before his eyes, and he fell down dead before the hearth. What can we think, but that too much Joy was the cauſe of his Death? What if <hi>Numantia</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> had been deliver'd to him!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>C. Catulus,</hi> a Captain of a greater Spirit, and Partaker with <hi>Marius</hi> in the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Triumph, by order of the Senate, had an end more violent. For by the ſame <hi>Marius</hi> afterwards commanded to death, covered himſelf up in his Bed, heated vehemently hot, and daub'd with new Lime, and ſo ſtifled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. At which time alſo <hi>L. Cornelius Merula,</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular Dignity, and Prieſt of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he might
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:41263:226"/>not be a ſcorn to the Inſolency of the Victors, opening his Veins in the Temple of <hi>Jove,</hi> avoided the denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of his Death.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A ſharp and ſtout end was that of <hi>Herennius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> who was both a Friend and Southſayer to <hi>C. Gracchus.</hi> For being for that reaſon carried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at the very threſhold of Ignominy he knock'd out his own Brains againſt the poſt of the door, and there died: One degree more ſwift than Publick Juſtice, or the hand of the Executioner.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As violent was the. End of <hi>C. Licinius Macer,</hi> a Praetorian, the Father of <hi>Calvus,</hi> being guilty of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; while the Suffrages were ſeparating, went into the place of Judgment, and ſeeing <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> who aſſembled the Judges, preparing to plead, he ſent to tell him, that <hi>he died not condemned, but guilty, and that his eſtate could not be confiſcated;</hi> and haying ſo ſaid, ſtopping his Mouth and Noſtrils with his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and holding his Breath, he prevented his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Death. Which being known, <hi>Cicero</hi> forbore to pronounce Sentence. Thus an Illuſtrious perſon freed himſelf from an unuſual ſort of Death, from the ſhame of Condemnation, and his Family from Want.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This a ſtout Death, the next ridiculous. For <hi>Cornelius Gallus,</hi> and <hi>

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:41263:226"/>as that of <hi>Coma,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Clean</hi> the greateſt Captain of Thieves in his time. For he being brought to <hi>Rupilius</hi> the Conſul after the taking of <hi>Enna,</hi> which the Thieves kept, being examined touching the force and deſignes of the Fugitives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming time to collect himſelf, he covered his Head, with his Knees bent, and holding his Breath, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd in the hands of his Keepers, and in the ſight of the ſupreme Command. Let the miſerable torment themſelves, to whom it is more profitable to dye than live, with timorous and dubious counſel how to end their Lives: Let them ſharpen their Knives, temper Poyſons, take Halters, view Precipices, as if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome preparation or exact method to ſeparate the ſtrict ſociety of Soul and Body. <hi>Coma</hi> made uſe of none of theſe, but his Soul being ſhut up in his breaſt, ſound its own way.</p>

But <hi>Pindarus</hi> laying his head in the School on a Boy's lap, who was his only delight, and compoſing himſelf for reſt, was not known to be dead, till the Maſter of the Exerciſing-place, where he lay, going to ſhut the doors, ſought in vain to wake him.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Vibius</hi> of a good Family, and <hi>Publicius</hi> the Freed-man were ſo like <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, that changing their condition, they might have been ſaluted for him, and he for them. Certainly, wherever <hi>Vibius</hi> or <hi>Publicius</hi> came, all mens eyes were upon them; every
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:41263:229"/>one remarking the form of a mighty Citizen in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of mean degree. Which kind of Mockery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came almoſt hereditary to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For his Father alſo was ſo exceeding like <hi>Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> his Cook, that a man fierce in Courage and potent in Arms could not avoid that ſordid name upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> a young man, illuſtrious for his Nobility, abounding in many famous Sirnames of his Family, could not ſcape the ſervile Appellation of <hi>Scrapio;</hi> being ſo like a Killer of the Sacrifices who was of that Name. Nor could the Probity of his Life, nor the Antiquity of his Family, any way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the Scandal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A moſt generous Colleagueſhip was that of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Metellus.</hi> Yet both were look'd upon as Players, ſo like they were to two Hiſtrio's upon the Stage. For the one got the ſirname of <hi>Spinther,</hi> an Actor of the Second Parts; and if the other had not had the ſirname of <hi>Nepos</hi> from his Anceſtors, he had had the ſirname of <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> an Actor of Third Parts, whom he ſo much reſembled.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>M. Meſſala,</hi> of Conſular Dignity, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to receive the ſirname of <hi>Menogenes;</hi> and <hi>Curio,</hi> abounding in wealth, that of <hi>Barbuleius:</hi> the one by reaſon of the likeneſs of their Faces; the other, becauſe of the likeneſs of their Gate.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Theſe are enough for Domeſticks, becauſe they are particularly remarkable in reference to the perſons, and not obſcure in relation to common knowledge. There was one <hi>Artemon</hi> by name, and related to the Royal Family, who was affirm'd to be very like to King <hi>Antiochus:</hi> Whom <hi>Laodice</hi> having murder'd her Husband, to conceal the fact, laid in her Husbands
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:41263:230"/>Bed, to counterfeit the King as ſick. And by his Countenance and Voice deceived all people that were admitted to ſee him, and believed that <hi>Laodice</hi> and her Children were recommended by dying <hi>Antiochus</hi> to their care.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hybreas</hi> of <hi>Mylaſa,</hi> an Oratour of a ſmart and copious Eloquence, was ſo like a Servant of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeans,</hi> that ſwept the Wraſtling-School, that all the eyes of <hi>Aſia</hi> took him for his own Brother; ſo like he was in all the Lineaments of Face and Members.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But he that was in <hi>Sicily</hi> ſo like the Praetor, was of a petulant diſpoſition. For the Proconſul ſaying, <hi>That be wonder'd how he ſhould come to be ſo like him, when his Father had never been in that Countrey; But mine,</hi> anſwered the other, <hi>went frequently to</hi> Rome. Revenging by that means the Injury done to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Chaſtity, by a Suſpition thrown upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Proconſul: yet more boldly than became a man that was under the Laſh and Axe of Authority.</p>

                  <p>THe former was a tolerable piece of Impudence, and only dangerous to himſelf. That which follows is no way to be endur'd, and not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but publickly dangerous.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Herophilus</hi> the Farrier, by claiming <hi>Marius</hi> ſeven times Conſul for his Grandfather, ſo ſet himſelf forth, that moſt of the Colonies of the Veterane Souldiers, and noble free Towns, adopted him for their Patron. Nay when <hi>Caeſar,</hi> having overcome young <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> had admitted the people into his Gardens, he was ſaluted in the next ſpace between the Pillars by the Multitude. And had nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> prudently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the ſtorm, the Commonwealth had ſuffer'd as much by him as by <hi>Equitius.</hi> But being baniſhed out of <hi>Italy</hi> by him, after he was taken into Heaven, the other return'd into the City, and durſt attempt to plot the killing of the Senate. For which reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the command of the Fathers put to Death in Priſon, he had the late reward of a quick intention to do miſchief.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither was the Deity of the World, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, ruling the world, exempt from this kinde of Impoſture: There being a certain perſon that durſt to affirm himſelf born of the womb of his moſt dear Siſter <hi>Octavia;</hi> ſaying, that for the infirmity of his body, he was put out to the perſon that bred him, and his Son taken in in his ſtead. Thus at the ſame time endeavouring to deprive a moſt ſacred Family of the Memory of their true Blood, and to contaminate it with the contagion of a Lye. But while he ſoar'd to the utmoſt degree of boldneſs, he was by <hi>Caeſar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to the Gallies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There was alſo one who affirm'd himſelf to be the Son of <hi>Q. Sertorius,</hi> whoſe Wife would by no means be compell'd to acknowledge him.</p>

However, the Conſtancy of the Judges would not give way, either to the Calumnies of the Claimer, nor the fury of the People.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Much more ſtoutly was that done by him, who when <hi>L.
